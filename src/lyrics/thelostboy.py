lyrics = '''
Uh, ok
We all got skeletons in our closet from a shady past
Made me brag about my Mercedes, Jag
Going fast, made me crash
My ex keeps fuckin' up my car with her crazy ass
Lately, sad
Reminisce the times, please take me back
Aimin' for the top, I'm on target like a Brady pass
Did a show for 80 cash, and threw it in my lady bag
That was fuckin' Easy Money Sniper on my KD swag
Thought about quitin', I'm a Warrior, can't take a jab
Whoever said shit was easy forever was lied
I mesmerize, how simple decisions can jeopardize
When Martin Luther cheated and stared in Coretta's eyes
This is lyrical exercise, told my idols to step aside
My momma said I'm buggin', no need for the pesticide
Was waitin' tables, gave customers extra fries
Maya Angelou with accounts, I just let it rise
And hopefully my words never die
Wintertime and it's rainin'
Well shit, I don't be complainin'
Summer's cold, shit is dangerous
Man, I can feel the changes
Uh, try to take a walk up in my shoes
A nigga rappin' like I really got somethin' to prove
'Cause motherfucker I do
I climb hills, nigga was sleepin' on Nyquil
Paint a picture, vivid dog, on everything my life's real
Was just in college, strugglin' to get a nice meal
Made it out the gutter, then that's all because of my skill
All because the glory nigga, let me tell my story
I am not that nigga with potential, I am not a warrior
I was lost like Dory, but I'm finally found
Was addicted to this Xans to calm anxiety down
And I never would admit because society clowns
Any nigga with a problem, they can't quiet me now, nigga
Wintertime and it's rainin'
Well shit, I don't be complainin'
Summer's cold, shit is dangerous
Man, I can feel the changes
Know where you come from, it's easy to get where you're going
Yeah
Just keep digging 'til you find out
Kidd
Ugh
Sweet Lord, please have mercy
Baby Jesus, please save us
I know I used up my three favors
Back to sinnin' like a week later
New car, speed racer
Cop a crib, need acres
Most of all, we all need prayer
Karma comin', beware
I don't know where I'm goin' (huh)
But I hope I'm on the right path
Life'll hit you with a light jab
Mike Tyson, strike back
You niggas goin' out slight sad
Know I'm all about my bag
New drip, I grab
I just wanna get my life back
There's no complainin' on this side
My niggas, shit is not tolerated
Cut some niggas off like a operation
And my team way more consolidated
Suite presidential, that's inauguration
'Cause we cookin' crack like Ronald Reagan
Chip on my shoulder, boy, I'm not for waitin'
Divine timin', took a lot of patience
Now it's time for the takeover, all gas and the brake's slower
Took a trip out to Tokyo, now I'm here in Paris for the layover
Fuck old niggas, boy, your day's over
You're mad at me 'cause your pay slower
Bitter nigga, you a shade-thrower, I was just sleepin' on a sofa
Now I ride with a paid chauffeur
'Cause I'm way doper, better stay sober
I paint pictures, you a Crayola
I got a bad bitch and she laid over
She really asked could she stay over?
I told her that we needed face closure
This mellow money has a great odor
These the things that I prayed over
Sweet Lord, please have mercy
Baby Jesus, please save us
I know I used up my three favors
Back to sinnin' like a week later
New car, speed racer
Cop a crib, need acres
Most of all, we all need prayer
Karma comin', beware
I don't know where I'm goin' (huh)
But I hope I'm on the right path
Life'll hit you with a light jab
Mike Tyson, strike back
You niggas goin' out slight sad
Know I'm all about my bag
New drip, I grab
I just wanna get my life back (huh, huh)
Why cry over spilled milk if you still feel I'm the real deal?
My bitch bad with no ill-will 'cause she'll murk a nigga like Kill Bill
Loose slips, sink ships, Cam'ron pink drip, that is my fashion
I'm not really with the high flashin', it's not helpin' with my braggin'
I penetrate it, been the greatest, new house, renovate it
I got the juice you eliminated, pussy-niggas always instigate it
Can't fuck me over boy, I'm too clever, that applies all to whoever
I'm just here to pursue pleasure, boy, I'm goin' out like Hugh Hefner
Sweet Lord, please have mercy
Baby Jesus, please save us
I know I used up my three favors
Back to sinnin' like a week later
New car, speed racer
Cop a crib, need acres
Most of all, we all need prayer
Karma comin', beware
I don't know where I'm goin' (huh)
But I hope I'm on the right path
Life'll hit you with a light jab
Mike Tyson, strike back
You niggas goin' out slight sad
Know I'm all about my bag
New drip, I grab
I just wanna get my life back
Baby Jesus, please save us
Baby Jesus, please save us
Aight, let's do that
Yeah, mmm
And one and two
And one, two
One
Sweet Lord, have mercy
Baby Jesus, please save us
I know I used up my three favors
Back to sinnin' like a week later
Sweet Lord, have mercy
Baby Jesus, please save us
I know I used up my three favors
Back to sinnin' like a week later
Ooh
(Ooh) yeah, uh (Bongo ByTheWay)
I know myself all too well to be a stranger of pain
Despite it all, we remainin' the same, I'm just changin' the game
Heart pure, never tainted with fame
Straight ahead, I'ma stay in my lane
Never switchin' courses, life's amazin', shit is gorgeous
Lookin' at the bigger picture, portrait, and I smile wide
Performed the song and the crowd cried
How can I lie? I'm tearin' up as I'm startin' to stare in y'all eyes
I know the shit you goin' through the last month
You stressin' as you hittin' on that glass blunt
A nigga prayin' to get lucky like Daft Punk
You can't even stomach the pain, now that's a bad lunch
Uh, ramen noodles on the regular
Add some seasoning and some hot sauce for a better touch
Peanut butter, jelly and syrup sandwich, ectcetera
And we just flyin' in the Nebula
And it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again
See, it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again
So don't you cry, little baby, little baby (don't you cry, don't you cry, don't you cry)
It'll be alright
So don't you cry, little baby, little baby (don't you cry, don't you cry, don't you cry)
It's gon', it'll be alright
I done been around the world four times, lookin' for parkin'
Finally found a condo, that shit still feel like apartment
Out South, my foul mouth started soundin' like Cartman
Roundabout like cartwheels, hopped inside of a U-Haul
Confused where all my art went, monsters in a quiet place
Some of these decisions is like Sharpie on a dry-erase
I know they thought I wouldn't, but I'm a fireplace
I had my cake and ate it too, that shit is an acquired taste
I promised I would buy a place, I got my favorite roommates
They used to never see me, like when you zip up a new Bape
Do that shit 'fore it's too late, don't ever drink the Kool-Aid
Don't ever think it's sweet, that's that crème de la brûlée
Who they? They Robert Goulet, they Nazi, cuckoo, goofy
My wifey yellin', "Who they?" My daughter yellin', "Hooray"
I see it clear like Blu-Ray, I park it in the sky
I keep 'em on my block, 'round the corner of my eye
Like a stye (uh)
So don't you shed a tear
'Cause there'll be better years
I live life by faith, nigga, instead of fear
God cryin', thunderstorms is Heaven tears
The feelin' of lost hope, shit is never here
'Cause we gon' make it happen by any means
A young nigga, dawg, but I done witnessed many things
Age thirteen, wearin' hand-me-down skinny jeans
You know they a little extra faded around the knees
With the grass stains in 'em
I really wish a little extra cash came in 'em,
'Cause a nigga really needed it
Pain, I defeated it, and brought back
Soul survivor, nigga, what you call that?
And it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again
See, it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again
So don't you cry, little baby, little baby (don't you cry, don't you cry, don't you cry)
It'll be alright
So don't you cry, little baby, (don't you cry, don't you cry, don't you cry)
It's gon', it'll be alright
And it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again
See, it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again
So don't you cry, little baby
It'll be alright
So don't you cry, little baby
It'll be alright
That's perfect, okay
Mac and cheese up in the oven, grandma finished cookin'
Thanksgiving 'round the corner, need banana pudding
Brought you home to mama even though you said I shouldn't
Might not make it to Christmas
But I'm hoping and I'm pushing for a better day
A good day in the making, but you never stay
I could say that you fakin' on the real, huh, nigga
Why you fakin' on the real? (uh, yeah, yeah)
You see I brought you home to mama
Introduced you to my cousins
Met my aunties and my uncles
Know they crazy, they be buggin', but
Promise that I got you, didn't bring you here for nothin'
Know we fightin', plus the arguments just lead into the fucking
Though some things never rearrange, I know we needin' change
Altogether through a deeper lane, come through, release the pain
I can be your ibuprofen, keep it real what I be hoping
Know you see all of it's destined, yeah, our shit was highly chosen
By the universe, the stars align, your love is far divine
Plus I'm really glad you keep it G, that shit is hard to find
Not to mention my intentions was always evolving time
Girl, I hope I'm in your future 'cause I know you fall in mine, uh
Mac and cheese up in the oven, grandma finished cookin'
Thanksgiving 'round the corner, need banana pudding
Brought you home to mama even though you said I shouldn't
Might not make it to Christmas
But I'm hoping and I'm pushing for a better day
A good day in the making, but you never stay
I could say that you fakin' on the real, huh, nigga
Why you fakin' on the real? (yeah, yeah)
You see I've always been an over thinker
I've always been the type to analyze
To no surprise that you hold the team up
The way this ship was built, there's no way that the loads could sink us
A humble shawty, model type, walking Vogue demeanor
But anyway, through many days
We on the block where Jenny stays
Honey baked ham with Henny glaze
Abraham inheritance, shawty, we plenty paid
Bonnie Clyde high speed chase, a renegade, but
Mac and cheese up in the oven, grandma finished cookin'
Thanksgiving 'round the corner, need banana pudding
Brought you home to mama even though you said I shouldn't
Might not make it to Christmas
But I'm hoping and I'm pushing for a better day
A good day in the making, but you never stay
I could say that you fakin' on the real, huh, nigga
Why you fakin' on the real? (yeah)
One of y'all niggas gon' be fuckin' with me
I got two bad bitches gon' be rubbin' my feet
I got three young niggas down to bust out the heat
And all y'all ain't got nothin' on me
Ooh, not one of y'all niggas gon' be fuckin' with me
I got two bad bitches gon' be rubbin' my feet
I got three young niggas down to bust out the heat
And all y'all ain't got nothin' on me
Uh, okay, put your fucking hands up, this the fucking anthem
Smiling 'cause I'm young, rich, black, and I'm handsome
Not to mention wealthy, ass on her healthy
Young millionaire, what the fuck can you tell me? Smell me?
Nigga, that's Chanel cologne
I'm in Europe with the tourists with no cellular phone
Like ooh, sound like rich nigga problems
I hit a bad bitch with a fistful of condoms
And the randomness of risky ménages
Like get the head right, she can get what she wanted
The spits, then flaunt it, my drip like a faucet
She told me she was preggo, I ain't even take the motherfuckin' dick out my pocket yet
The opposite
She want me to fly her, so I copped a jet
Must be thinkin' I'm a one way ticket on a runway
Drippin' in my feng shui, sippin' on a sundae
One of y'all niggas gon' be fuckin' with me
I got two bad bitches gon' be rubbin' my feet
I got three young niggas down to bust out the heat
And all y'all ain't got nothin' on me
Ooh, not one of y'all niggas gon' be fuckin' with me
I got two bad bitches gon' be rubbin' my feet
I got three young niggas down to bust out the heat
And all y'all ain't got nothin' on me
I bought a Moncler coat for the times we were broke
I'ma wear it in the summer on LeBron James boat
Front row? Duh, bro, we don't sit on nosebleeds
Ain't your pockets obese? They won't fit in those seats
Ay, we like a cold team, nigga, Shaq and Kobe
Like back in '03, I was only like 6
Shit, I was like 16, but I can give a sixteen
I can make a bitch scream, that's a bit extreme
I got a thick bald bitch, I call her Ms. Clean
My drip frosty like Halls and Listerine
We all all-stars, you hardly sixth string
Yeah, I had to ball hard to harvest these dreams
Swear to God, me too, no Harvey Weinstein
The coupe was lime green, my wrist was blinding
We party in South Beach, Ferraris and blue cheese
Fuck does that even mean? Nigga, just let the hook sing
One of y'all niggas gon' be fuckin' with me
I got two bad bitches gon' be rubbin' my feet
I got three young niggas down to bust out the heat
And all y'all ain't got nothin' on me
Ooh, not one of y'all niggas gon' be fuckin' with me
I got two bad bitches gon' be rubbin' my feet
I got three young niggas down to bust out the heat
And all y'all ain't got nothin' on me
Uh, yeah
Daytrip took it to ten (hey)
I was broke as fuck, down up on my ass, had the lowest luck
Used to ride the bike up to the store, I need a Rover truck
A Bentley coupe, yeah, I'm wearin' Prada, I like Fendi too
Grandma passed, had a heart attack, only 62
My cousin shot, got me paranoid, who to trust or not
Gave my brother 25 years, that really sucked a lot
Post-traumatic stress is building up, you niggas so dramatic
Fuck these other niggas, I'm the illest, I'm the coldest at it (yeah, uh)
Let me take you niggas back to a much simpler time
Picture yourself inside a vehicle, a ship in my mind
You'll see some childhood memories mixed with the cells of a don
You'll see the doctor smack my ass when I first fell out my mom
A Magic School Bus adventure trip inside my cerebral
Back when I told niggas I'll make it, swear they didn't believe him
Flashback to Brasstracks and we was playin' "No Problems"
We was crankin' all the classics from the spring to the autumn
And I said motherfuck, need a bad bitch with a tummy tuck
How I make a million from a dollar? It was dummy luck
Need a new Lam', no sedan, fuck a Hummer truck
I'm aiming for the top, I'm steady climbing, fuck a runner-up
I was broke as fuck, down up on my ass, had the lowest luck
Used to ride the bike up to the store, I need a Rover truck
A Bentley coupe, yeah, I'm wearin' Prada, I like Fendi too
Grandma passed, had a heart attack, only 62
My cousin shot, got me paranoid, who to trust or not
Gave my brother 25 years, that really sucked a lot
Post-traumatic stress is building up, you niggas so dramatic
Fuck these other niggas, I'm the illest, I'm the coldest at it, ay
Uh-huh (hey)
Yeah
Woo
Uh, yeah, uh
Mom and dad never had a damn thing, damn shame
Now I'm poppin' champagne on a private jet, fuck an airplane
Order Bossa Nova, eating plantains
Presidential Rollie, fuck a campaign
Impeach, nigga, ten deep, nigga
Remember days we was wearin' J's
And a gold chain, only had three figures
So fortunate, proportionate
Lost Boy, nigga, no coordinates
Remember Christmas? We was giftless
Three foot tree, no ornaments
Pull my dick out, hoes swarmin' it
Flow cold, nigga, no warmin' it
Mama couldn't afford AAU
So we couldn't hoop, nigga, no tournaments
I remember days sippin' lemonade
Ice cream truck gettin' plenty paid
Candy lady had Jolly Ranchers
I don't really have a lot of answers
I'm just searching for the same shit
Same niggas that I came with
Premonitions over reminiscing
Lamb' truck how I lane switch (ah)
Uh
They say a picture's worth a thousand words
You paint a canvas, better let it shine, huh
I know I done some things that's dead wrong, huh
The flash is on this little light of mine, yeah
They say a picture's worth a thousand words
You paint a canvas, better let it shine, huh
I know I done some things that's dead wrong, uh
The flash is on this little light of mine, yeah
Uh, a picture's worth a thousand words, a video worth a million
But no amount of likes can heal up all this pain that I'm feeling
Maybe conceal it, and hide in all these problems we deal with
I grew up on the principle, to raise a child, need a village
I think we all wanna be a little Instagram famous
Deep down inside, nobody really wanna be nameless
Afraid of being forgotten, so this troll shit, we plottin'
Sittin' on this phone for hours, feel my brain getting rotten
But I can give a fuck less, dawg, a nigga is poppin'
All these bitches that's flockin', shit, a nigga got options
But what's really important is such a silly distortion
We all stuck in this matrix, tryna hide our misfortunes
They say a picture's worth a thousand words
You paint a canvas, better let it shine, huh
I know I done some things that's dead wrong, huh
The flash is on this little light of mine, yeah
They say a picture's worth a thousand words
You paint a canvas, better let it shine, huh
I know I done some things that's dead wrong, uh
The flash is on this little light of mine, yeah
Uh, living in this false reality that's in this picture gallery
Based on a nigga's profile, we guessin' salary
The lifestyle you advertise was quite strategized
Make a minimal amount and then we maximize
These niggas cappin' with lies how they capitalize
Creating they own perceptions, what a massive facade
Digital marketing schemes even broader regime
Live how you want on the internet, who thought of this thing?
I mean, I guess it ain't the worst shit, if life was picture perfect
Who could paint a picture vivid as media circus?
The surface is much deeper than even the Earth is
I searched it, lookin' for purpose like my first kiss
At the same time this shit will have you feeling worthless
Back into reality, woke up and just reversed it
Now I'm a new man, even got a new 'Gram
But let me take a picture with this money by my new Lamb'
They say a picture's worth a thousand words
You paint a canvas, better let it shine, huh
I know I done some things that's dead wrong, huh
The flash is on this little light of mine, yeah
They say a picture's worth a thousand words
You paint a canvas, better let it shine, huh
I know I done some things that's dead wrong, uh
The flash is on this little light of mine, yeah
Uh, you can be who you wanna be
But, rather be myself, for real
No pretending, no fake in me
'Cause gettin' out this shell is real
I don't know where I'm headed next, but
Man, I can't even fake no more
Surrounded by lies and bullshit
Nigga, I can't even take no more
See, I woke up havin' a bad day
And I gotta get the dollar any faster way
'Cause a nigga growin' up never had shit
I was actin' way too passive
I've been up and down, round and round
Tryna find my way back home
Gone too long, drownin' out
Still gonna play that song
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay any of you right
Never got that text back from the other night
Let me tell you something that I really know
I was down bad, up on my ass, I had to go, okay?
Sometimes I know I'm dead wrong
So I just put it all in these songs
Shit, I'm still just finding myself, finding myself up out of this zone, nigga
Wish me well, Jezebel, get out of my sight
I excel, then I sell shows out for the night
Uh, you can be who you wanna be
But, rather be myself, for real
No pretending, no fake in me
'Cause gettin' out this shell is real
I don't know where I'm headed next, but
Man, I can't even fake no more
Surrounded by lies and bullshit
Nigga, I can't even take no more
See, I woke up havin' a bad day
And I gotta get the dollar any faster way
'Cause a nigga growin' up never had shit
I was actin' way too passive
I've been up and down, round and round
Tryna find my way back home
Gone too long, drownin' out
Still gonna play that song
Tryna find my way back home
I been gone 8 months out the year so far
Made a wrong turn on the dark road on my way back
Crossed through a couple toll roads, had to pay tax
Back in forth, I been fuckin' back
Had to get it back, had to bring it back
Shit so different now, had to readjust
And too many people that I could trust
Keep to myself (ay) spend this shit all on myself (uh)
Where would I be without self? (uh)
Look in the mirror like, "Boy you look good"
Yeah, that's why I had to pick up myself (pick up myself)
I'm doin' me, you should do you, fuck everybody else
Don't need nobody else
Uh, you can be who you wanna be
But, rather be myself, for real
No pretending, no fake in me
'Cause gettin' out this shell is real
I don't know where I'm headed next, but
Man, I can't even fake no more
Surrounded by lies and bullshit
Nigga, I can't even take no more
See, I woke up havin' a bad day
And I gotta get the dollar any faster way
'Cause a nigga growin' up never had shit
I was actin' way too passive
I've been up and down, round and round
Tryna find my way back home
Gone too long, drownin' out
Still gonna play that song
When you, when you was in Chicago still
Did you find yourself like as a lost boy?
Yep, mmh
No mother
I think I could do better, but I still
I want this forever
Uh, sometimes life's about the people you know
Watchin' a flower bloom as its features will grow
I mean, I never been one to preach to them folks
I'm just speakin' from experience, my teachings is dope
Learning lessons with my brethren, joy is quite contagious
Counting blessings on blessings, my heart right to make it
And it's kinda my only option, maybe my decisions
Haven't really been the best, but this my life I'm livin'
Although it seem so bittersweet when you ain't got nothing to eat
And Sallie Mae callin' your phone for like the fifth time this week
All your bills overdue, all your bitches over you
Only one option remains, you just gotta show and prove
And so I know, little darling
I know how the pain, it hurts
Say something to me sweetie
We'll get through, we'll make it work
'Cause I've been around
And you've caught me down bad, I say
Next time in town
You're always welcome 'round my way
Uh, so take risks and live spontaneous, I'm so insane
But that's the shit that make me rich and why we love the game
And to my various enemies who carrying energy
Of greed and envy, just know I love you for centuries
So all is forgiven, animosity for none
'Cause I done been through a lot, thankful who I have become
I done lost a couple brothers, dead cousins on the regular
But I ain't even stressing, count my blessings, know we headed up
I dropped out of school, pops thinkin' I'm a fool
It may seem all cool, but I'm feelin' awful
I was down in the dumps with my confidence gone
But then my whole life changed, droppin' prominent songs
And so I know, little darling
I know how the pain, it hurts
Say something to me sweetie
We'll get through, we'll make it work
'Cause I've been around
And you've caught me down bad, I say
Next time in town
You're always welcome 'round my way
Okay, uh
I can tell you how I first started in this rap shit
Momma kicked a nigga out the house, felt fantastic
Told my homies "If you got a couch, know I'm crashin'
Worried 'bout my future, couldn't care about the past tense
Lost my grandmother, and I haven't been the same since
Start to get anxious, I'm tired of this lame shit
Tired of the struggle livin' family in the subdivision
Ramen noodles, drawin' doodles wasn't in my fuckin' vision
But who's fault is that? Tryna stay all intact
Fightin' all my demons, they be schemin', but I'm crawlin' back
And eventually flyin', lately been mentally cryin'
Niggas resentin' me, I am not for the industry lyin'
Life's a dream, but nothin' is a fairy tale
Do you love me, I can barely tell
'Cause I'm up an down, been all around, nobody's callin' now
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no
Uh, 'cause I know what I been through
But I still, uh, I'd do it all over again
And my life is so sinful (YBN, why be them?)
But through times (King Push), uh, the good guys always win
I can tell you how I first started in this rap shit
8th grade, backflippin' on the mattress
9th grade pack, doin gymnastic
10th grade, somersaultin' all them crack flips
Asterix, skip school, record it with The Neptunes
We was makin' high school classics
Before I took a kilo and I rapped it, I wrapped it
Around the funeral, with the casket (ugh)
Coke avalanche, like a landslide
Only grew my hair this long, because my man died
Collect calls on them landlines, I pressed 5
To tell about the new test drive, and talk fly, ooh
Life's a dream, but nothin' is a fairy tale
Do you love me, I can barely tell
'Cause I'm up an down, been all around, nobody's callin' now
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no
Uh, 'cause I know what I been through
But I still, uh, I'd do it all over again
And my life is so sinful
But through times, uh, the good guys always win
Uh, I got an auntie who be raisin' her daughter's kids
She's 46, one is 1, one is 2, others 4 and 6
Baby dad ain't really with that supportive shit
I come to town iced out with the foreign drip
I got another cousin, she the same age as me
Our lifestyles completely different and basically
Her baby dad beat her ass, what I hate to see
Her black eye as I cried, it's a daily thing, uh
And here I am chasin' dreams
Ignorant with bliss, worryin' 'bout plays and streams
The crazy part is they don't even say a thing
They don't want me to worry, just go and make the cream
I got an aunt with a cheatin' husband, always knew he bogus
Used to wear turtlenecks and some Louis loafers
Comin' home to family struggles got me losin' focus
I don't know how else to deal so it's too late now
I got a brother out there who like 5 years old
I don't know why daddy tried to hide your soul
No blood test needed 'cause it just might be
Seen the picture, lil' man lookin' just like me
It be the ones that's closest
That go through the motions
Maybe it's me that's been selfish
Don't know why I can't help it
And it's been hard for me
To see what you been goin' through, it's tirin'
'Cause you've been sufferin', you've been sufferin'
No more sufferin' in silence
And they don't even ask for shit
When I was broke, grandma MoneyGram-ed me cash and shit
And she wasn't even the one that was havin' it
Family be matterin' most, but as a catalyst
I got another cousin buggin' who addicted to Xans
Said it was her substitute for never gettin' a man
Said we all need love, only if it's in the plan
Forced love the worst love, throw that shit in the can
I got an auntie who a prostitute, it hurt my soul
Promise you sellin' your body ain't worth that gold
Reverse that role, you don't gotta swerve that road
Searching for the answers, I don't wanna search that low
'Cause I done been through a lot, my family goes through worse
Cryin' on this airplane how I wrote this verse
They be sufferin' in silence, they don't tell me a thing
All they tell me is, "Nigga, go excel in your dreams"
Yeah, it be the ones that's closest
That go through the motions
Maybe it's me that's been selfish
Don't know why I can't help it
And it's been hard for me
To see what you been goin' through, it's tirin'
'Cause you've been sufferin', been sufferin'
No more sufferin' in silence
It be the ones that's closest
That go through the motions
Maybe it's me that's been selfish
Don't know why I can't help it
And it's been hard for me
To see what you been goin' through, it's tirin'
You've been sufferin', been sufferin'
No more sufferin' in silence
Yeah
God bless the Dream Chasers
If you got a dream, keep chasin' it
Never let nobody hate you out your dreams
You gon' make it, yeah
I could have died on that pavement
Every time I see my mom, I be like "Wait a minute'"
She knows there's somethin' wrong with me, but I don't say shit
And I been tired of chasin' dreams, but I'm gon' chase it
Shit, we ain't never had a shot, how we gon' take it?
Success is in my arm reach, and I can taste it
In the mansion, I was just down in the basement
They ain't believe in me, but I'm gon' make it
See I know how it feels on the late night
Swimmin' with the great whites
Drownin' in the deep waters, know you got 3 daughters
Could use some resources, nah, we just need order
I got my own bad news, fuck a reporter
Niggas ain't even safe, they wanna deport us
A ride to keep us boxed in on the street corners
If you gon' stop and frisk a nigga, shit, at least warn us
My dog still on probation, they got a leash on us
Far from stupid, and fact, I'm smarter than Harvard students
Sparked a movement, and put a end to this garbage music
Got me thinkin' like this can't be life
These stupid ass niggas voted for the anti-Christ
I could have died on that pavement
Every time I see my mom, I be like "Wait a minute'"
She knows there's somethin' wrong with me, but I don't say shit
And I been tired of chasin' dreams, but I'm gon' chase it
Shit, we ain't never had a shot, how we gon' take it?
Success is in my arm reach, and I can taste it
In the mansion, I was just down in the basement
They ain't believe in me, but I'm gon' make it
Yeah
It was hell here, my people killin', and the 12 here
Got my mom a Black Card, and she was just on welfare, that's goals
Did it on my own, I got myself here
When God asked me do I want this shit, I said "Hell yeah"
I'm ready, when I put the crown on, it was heavy
I was drownin' in my past, like when Katrina broke the levees in New Orleans
And my city to them kids, I'm like joy
Every move I make like chess is important
I just went against the system, spendin' nights tryna reform it
Late at night thinkin', I can lose my life just from doin' this
It's a sacrifices, I know it won't be right if I forfeit
But I do it for the young kings, that never had no voices, for real
I could have died on that pavement
Every time I see my mom, I be like "Wait a minute'"
She knows there's somethin' wrong with me, but I don't say shit
And I been tired of chasin' dreams, but I'm gon' chase it
Shit, we ain't never had a shot, how we gon' take it?
Success is in my arm reach, and I can taste it
In the mansion, I was just down in the basement
They ain't believe in me, but I'm gon' make it
Yeah, okay, I reminisce the cold days in Winter time
Got home by dinner time
7/11 runs, Gatorade, flavor: Lemon-Lime
Hot Cheetos, Arizonas, oranges, clementine
The first job I ever applied for was Finish Line
Some time a nigga be forgettin', then remember I'm-
Savior of the rap shit, the leader of the Renaissance
Self appointed, while anointed for my endeavors
I'm ironin' cheddar, applyin pressure, defyin' set-ups
The rap game is based upon what niggas lyin' better
If truth is told, then you can grow, and die in never
No, I'm everlastin', better graspin', this thing in life
I heard Meek hook, and I told him to sing it twice, my God
I could have died on that pavement
Every time I see my mom, I be like "Wait a minute'"
She knows there's somethin' wrong with me, but I don't say shit
And I been tired of chasin' dreams, but I'm gon' chase it
Shit, we ain't never had a shot, how we gon' take it?
Success is in my arm reach, and I can taste it
In the mansion, I was just down in the basement
They ain't believe in me, but I'm gon' make it
Switch up my lifestyle
Yuh, yuh, uh, huh
Yeah, I was a lost boy, now I'm found
Niggas switched up, they can't come around
To these rap niggas biting my sound
Shout out my bitch for holdin' it down
I had to switch up my lifestyle
If she bad I'ma go fuck her lights out
Momma always told me I was a bright child
Naked pictures saved on my iCloud
My goodness, my God, my gracious
Got a bad little bitch, my favorite
And I eat the pussy like it's caviar
Nigga I ain't talkin' bout that playlist
Most necessary, cold February
Flow never bury, shit is everlastin'
Opportunity is never passin'
Was just in school, skippin' hella classes
New whip hit the pedal thrashin'
Grew up where I heard the metal blastin'
I know that greed is the Devil's passion
Wears Prada and Stilleto fashion
Gucci has become the ghetto fashion
I am just another rebel rappin'
But that studio time led to Louis Vitton, that I just bought for my mom
Celebration, mix Ciroc and a lime
Rest in peace X, the Pac of his time
Was manifested, can't stop the divine
Nigga speakin' like Barack in his prime
But I'm Bill Clinton with the ill writtens, make the real listen
Seen Monica Lewinsky in the Hills strippin'
I was late, call me Mike Jones 'cause I'm still tippin'
Call up Scotty with the shotty, 'cause I feel Pippen
I'm a real Fresh Prince, Uncle Phil, listen
And tell Will Smith how I kill shit
And to please adopt a young nigga, man I'm tryna get real rich
Nah I'm playin', shoutout to Jaden
So iconic how I go Super Saiyan
New bitch foreign, straight from the Himalayans
On top soon, Lord knows I been prayin'
'Cause I'm on my grind, watch how I kickflip
Money notorious, I'm buyin' big shit
God is so glorious, bless me with riches
I was just broke, now I'm a rich kid
Gas what I smoke, that shit is vicious
Give me that throat, say it's delicious
Rappers is jokes, I'm a musician
Rappers is jokes, I'm a musician
None of these niggas want smoke with me
So hopefully, my flow will breed, some rappers with actual potency
Spit hot lava, erode the beat, my God
What you think of that, Brent?
