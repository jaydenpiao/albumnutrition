We ain't good good, but we still good
We ain't good good, but we still good
I hate that we didn't make it to forever
Probably ain't gettin' back together
But that don't mean that I can't wish you better
We ain't good good, but we still good
I realize that I can't be your lover
Let's just keep it honest with each other
I'll be happy for you when you find another
We ain't good good, but we still good
Who knew it'd be like this?
Usually my exes turn to enemies
But this is different
'Cause we done got closer now that you ain't with me (oh)
All that love that we had
Ain't no way we gon' forget that
And your family love me like I'm family
You know where you stand with me
So when they ask, tell 'em
Right one, right place, wrong time
Can't say we didn't try
But you always been a real one
Even though we ain't together
It was real love, and baby, it's still love
I hate that we ain't make it to forever
Probably ain't gettin' back together
But that don't mean that I can't wish you better (oh-oh)
We ain't good good, but we still good
I realize that I can't be your lover
Let's just keep it honest with each other
I'll be happy for you when you find another
We ain't good good, but we still good
All them plans you made for me to be your missus
All the stacks that you done spent on me at Lenox
It don't go forgotten, but we're happier apart than locked in (locked in)
No smoke with me, I promise, boy, I don't do drama
It didn't work, but I hope you find another
I wish you peace, I wish you good sex, and good sleep
Find the girl of your dreams
'Cause I sleep well at night knowin' this ain't meant to be (oh)
Right one, right place, wrong time
Can't say we didn't try
All good things come to an end
So let's just learn the lessons and find lovin' again
I hate that we ain't make it to forever
Probably ain't gettin' back together
But that don't mean that I can't wish you better
We ain't good good, but we still good
I realize that I can't be your lover (lover)
Let's just keep it honest with each other (other)
I'll be happy for you when you find another
We ain't good good, but we still good
No matter who you with, I wanna see you happy (on God)
Yeah, it didn't work out but that don't mean you should attack me (21, 21)
We enjoy the five-star meals, but you was with me for the Zaxby's (facts)
Holdin' me down from the start (21), I used to be broke, I was ashy (21)
I hate we didn't tie the knot, but shit, that's how life go (on God)
You always would say that I might blow (21)
Got rich and I paid for your lipo' (21)
I know the person you is (yeah)
That's why I still wanna be friends (on God)
If you wanna open up a new salon, I still help pay for the wigs (straight up)
And I'd help with the lease (on God)
You know I ain't never been cheap (21)
Relationships don't always last, but let's not turn it to beef (21)
I come through from time to time and have you grabbin' them sheets (21)
That's if you want to, I'm just playin', girl, stop smackin' your teeth (21, 21)
I hate that we didn't make it to forever (you know)
Probably ain't gettin' back together
But that don't mean that I can't wish you better (don't mean I can't wish you better)
We ain't good good, but we still good (we still good)
I realize that I can't be your lover (no)
Let's just keep it honest with each other
I'll be happy for you when you find another (another)
We ain't good good, but we still good

Shouldn't have loved you like I did, oh
Baby, I shouldn't have loved you like I did, oh
Shouldn't have loved you like I did, oh
Baby, I shouldn't have loved you like I did, oh
Maybe I should've stopped at a good time
Tell them pretty eyes and them pretty thighs
Goodbye for the night, got a early rise
You mad at me, what a tragedy
Made you majesty, it's riveting
I'm pivoting, but that one left drastically
Feel like I'm in Gangland
How this bitch playin' with me?
You made me a changed man
My love was too good for you really (clearly)
Tell them I wasn't everything you asked me for
Tell them I didn't change your life, we both know
Baby, I shouldn't have loved you like I did, oh
Baby, I shouldn't have loved you like I did, oh
Maybe I shouldn't have loved you like I did, oh
Baby, I shouldn't have loved you like I did, oh
Ever seen my fist in the cold? Cut my whole world enough
It'll never get that bad
Wanna see a nigga money fucked up, bitch, you got me fucked up
It'll never get that bad
No ice on my neck, no Fiji on the jet
Nigga, it'll never get that bad
This ain't Russian roulette, what you expect?
Bitch, it'll never get that bad
Now you're supposed to be a friend of mine
Yet you turned cold at the drop of a dime
Oh, I see you wavering every time the wind blows
Got me peeking out of this window's soul
Shame how you pull on my heart strings, oh
And every time I try and make it better
End up regretting things
Oh, whoa
I don't wanna turn my back on all this love we had
Nah, I don't wanna turn my back on all that love we made
Oh, I thought that we had something real
How did bad get that bad?
Shouldn't have loved you like I did, oh
Shouldn't have loved you like I did, oh-whoa-oh
Never should've loved you like I did, no
Nah
Ever seen my fist in the cold? Cut my whole world enough
It'll never get that bad
Wanna see a nigga money fucked up, bitch, you got me fucked up
It'll never get that bad (it'll never get that bad)
No ice on my neck, no Fiji on the jet
Nigga, it'll never get that bad (it'll never get that bad)
This ain't Russian roulette, what you expect?
Bitch, it'll never get that bad (it'll never get that bad)

Is it messed up I hope you would be here
Only so I could act like I don't care?
Been a blur for the last two months
Got a glass on my lips and a burn in my chest
Got some new fingertips on the back of my neck
Gotta try to pretend, gotta try to forget
Somehow, but how, how?
How we go from strangers kissing, to kissing strangers?
From not knowing your name, to wishing I could erase it
Tryna forget with somebody new that I'm missing you
How we go from strangers kissing, to kissing strangers?
From feeling every high there is, to just feeling anxious
Tryna forget in a crowded room, whoa, that I'm missing you
All of the nights we stayed up making plans
Now I stay up trying to understand (understand)
Been a blur for the last three months
Got a glass on my lips and a burn in my chest
Got some new fingertips on the back of my neck
Gotta try to pretend, I would die to forget
Somehow, but how, how?
How we go from strangers kissing, to kissing strangers?
From not knowing your name, to wishing I could erase it
Tryna forget with somebody new that I'm missing you
How we go from strangers kissing, to kissing strangers?
From feeling every high there is, to just feeling anxious
Tryna forget in a crowded room, whoa, that I'm missing you
Still see your face
In everybody, everybody (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can't feel the space
With anybody, anybody
How we go from strangers kissing, to kissing strangers?
From not knowing your name, to wishing I could erase it? (Yeah)
Tryna forget with somebody new that I'm missing you
How we go from strangers kissing, to kissing strangers?
From feeling every high there is, to just feeling anxious
Tryna forget in a crowded room, whoa, that I'm missing you
Still see your face
Can't feel the space (whoa)
Tryna forget in a crowded room, whoa, that I'm missing you (oh)

I admit breakin' up is easier than commitment
But I don't want that for us
Our love is strong enough to never have an endin'
There are problems everywhere
Heartbreak in the air
We say we don't care, we're in our own world
When it feels like we're on our own
We ain't afraid to stand alone
We go back to what we know
Tell 'em what we learned
When the chips are down and you hit the ground
And you feelin' like the love you had is vanished (oh)
When the music goes off and the DJ's goin' home
Get back out on that floor and keep on dancin'
Gotta keep on dancin'
Even if the music stops, we gotta give it all we got
We keep on dancin' (keep on)
Dancin' (keep on)
Dancin' (keep on)
Dancin'
Who has time for breakin' up
If we're too stuck on our mission?
As long as we can both agree
That even if we say we're done, we're never really finished
There are problems everywhere
Heartbreak in the air
We say that we don't care, we're livin' in our own world
When it feels like we're on our own
We ain't afraid to stand alone
We go back to what we know
Tell 'em what we learned
When the chips are down and you hit the ground
And you feelin' like the love you had is vanished
When the music goes off and the DJ's goin' home
Get back out on that floor and keep on dancin'
You get out the floor
Even if the music stops, we gotta give it all we got
We keep on dancin' (keep on)
Dancin' (keep on)
Dancin' (keep on)
Dancin'
Give it all you got
Give it, give it all you got
Keep, keep on dancin'
Give it all you got
Gotta give it all you got
Keep, keep on dancin'
Give it all you got
Give it, give it all you got
Keep, keep on dancin' (oh, keep movin')
Give it all you got
Give it, give it all you got
Keep, keep on -
When the chips are down and you hit the ground
And you feelin' like the love you had is vanished (is vanished)
When the music goes off and the DJ's goin' home
Get back out on that floor and keep on dancin'
Gotta keep on dancin'
Even if the music stops, we gotta give it all we got
We keep on dancin'
Dancin' (dancin')
Dancin' (dancin')
Dancin' (dancin')

Let's go
Yeah (oh)
Yeah
Yeah, baby
Listen
Like a condition, like a religion
So easily mistreated, scary decision
Sometimes it's hell and sometimes it's heaven
It's overcomplicated, but baby
I don't mind
Feeling like I'm bound to fall (fall)
Close my eyes
Baby, I would risk it all (all), yeah
Sometimes it's tragic, so problematic
People are cryin' for it, people are dyin' for it
Always the reason (always), we still believe in (we still)
Something that leaves us hurting, it's worth it
I don't mind
Feeling like I'm bound to fall (fall, fallin', oh)
Close my eyes
Baby, I would risk it all
Just to be in love
(Be in) be in love
Oh, I just wanna be (be in love)
Be in love, yeah
I don't mind
Feeling like I'm bound to fall (oh, baby)
Baby, I close my eyes
Baby, I would risk it all
I don't mind
Feeling like I'm bound to fall
Close my eyes
Baby, I would risk it all
Oh, just to be in love
Be in love
Be in love, be in love, be in love, yeah

I need your body, baby (killer)
Wanna feel your body, baby
I'ma kill your body, baby, tonight
Lie on me (yeah)
Baby, die on me
Don't be shy on me
Keep your eyes on me

Two months to be exact
And I miss you, babe, in fact
Drivin' me crazy, baby (yeah, mm, ah)
So why don't we just go somewhere (somewhere)
Where me and you can hide it out? (Fly)
Hide it out (hey), hey

Girl, I miss you in the evenings
Girl, I miss you like I never knew

Come back and make this song stop
Don't let this turn into a bop
Don't let this turn into a bop (no, no)
Don't let this turn into a bop
Mi amor, ti adore
Can't get you off my mind
I think about you all the time
Some days I lay in the dark and stay in the blind
You ain't moonwalkin', crawl my heart like young Michael
I still can't accept that loss like Mike Tyson
Friends chimin' in, got you undecided
Hit that defrost for the kid, un-ice it
Done remisnicin'
They get no more attention from me
Textin' goodbye my old friend
Oh, no, now I go lyin' again
Been a minute
Two months to be exact
And I miss you, babe, in fact
Drivin' me crazy, yeah
'Cause I miss you in the mornin'
And I miss you in the afternoon

Go ahead and shut me down for good
Don't have me lingerin' (oh)
My pretty little thing

Give me a chance, I just wanna be your man again
I just wanna be in the plan again
I just wanna be, ooh, anything you want me to do, whoa
Don't let this turn into a bop
Don't let this turn into a bop (no, no)

Margiela
My thief in the night
So sweet, the way you lie
And those dollar signs in your eyes
Stop actin' so shy
Come and get your money
Come get it, come get it, come get it
What your friends tell ya 'bout me?
You want me to NFL ya, you want that NBA check
Pop somethin' at Coachella, Margiela
Oh, you want that old me
But right now I'm kinda feelin' like Pimp C, I can't hold you
Just pay the shit, it's just a couple coupes and I'm over you
When old love turns jealous
My new love is overzealous
I'm in the middle, Margiela
Jump in the wagon, over here floatin' like Aladdin
She rubbin' on me, wishin' for shit
She gotta have it
Thick lips, that black magic
Whippin' this thang, swervin' in and out of my lane
Get a grip, that's what I'm doin'
Fill her up, that's what I'm doin'
Steering wheel at the same time, that '24 with low miles
She talkin' that rock-star shit, she talkin' in bad bitch
You ain't shit, she said, "You ain't either"
What if I told the world? She said, "Who'd believe ya?"
Come and get your money
Come get it, come get it, come get it
What your friends tell ya 'bout me?
You want me to NFL ya, you want that NBA check
Pop somethin' at Coachella, Margiela
Oh, you want that old me
But right now I'm kinda feelin' like Pimp C, I can't hold you
Just pay the shit, it's just a couple coupes and I'm over you
When old love turns jealous
My new love is overzealous
I'm in the middle, Margiela
She's tryna make things right
Just pullin' me back in, pullin' me back in, my new girl keep
Askin' 'bout us, and I'm like
You don't wanna know, girl, shut the door, let it go
And leave the past right there and get that ass over here
In the air right there
Let me put this picture in your perfect frame
Come make me fall in love again
I swear that we would never change
But while I'm fuckin' you, all I fuckin' see is her face
Get a grip, that's what I'm doin'
Paint her lips, that's what I'm doin'
When I left her I swore that I'd be fine
Now I can't seem to find my mind
Now you both see the dog nigga in me
All I see is fog from the Remy, I care
You thought I should've cared more
I could say the same, I could lay the blame on you
But there's only one thing a rich nigga can do
Come and get your money
Come get it, come get it, come get it
What your friends tell ya 'bout me?
You want me to NFL ya, you want that NBA check
Pop somethin' at Coachella, Margiela
Oh, you want that old me
But right now I'm kinda feelin' like Pimp C, I can't hold you
Just pay the shit, it's just a couple coupes and I'm over you
When old love turns jealous
My new love is overzealous
I'm in the middle, Margiela
I'm in the middle
You want me to love you, but when you love me
You want it fair, find any way to be here
Now that I'm not there no more
She's tryna make things right
Just pullin' me back in, pullin' me back in
Margiela

I ain't wanna do it
I ain't wanna say it
I just been tryna take it, but I've been goin' through it
Done with the fakin', tryin' not to lose it
I need a room, I need a place
A place to get off some shit that's on my mind
What would you do if I say, "I need space"?
Even if it's space from you
I bought some room 'cause I'm tryna keep the peace
Tryna keep the savage nigga on a leash
'Cause he be tryna eat
Ain't tryna move 'cause I got ties I ain't never tryin' to lose
Just tryna find me some room in this room
Ah, too many glasses of that Migos
Got a nigga in a casa
Lookin' through IG hoes
Ain't tryna cheat though
They just be poppin' up like some new Impala
But you knew me before
So you like to hold my past against me
Whenever I be on the phone
When real talk, I ain't the only one who's on the phone
Girl, you be on the phone
I need a room, I need a place
A place to get off some shit that's on my mind
What would you do if I say, "I need space"?
Even if it's space from you
Yeah, I'm tryna keep the peace
Tryna keep the savage nigga on a leash
'Cause he be tryna eat
And I'm not tryna move, he got ties I ain't never tryin' to lose
Just tryna find me some room in this room
You get 'em, that's how you keep 'em
And how you fall off, that's why you leave 'em (ooh)
Ain't no love if the love is dead to make (ooh)
You can laugh off what you did yesterday
Oh, where do we go from here to fix the disconnect and reconnect
To what we had when we first met?
And get back what we knew
I ain't tryna fuck it up with you
I just need a room, I need a place
A place to get off some shit that's on my mind
What would you do if I say, "I need space"?
Even if it's space from you
All I want it to keep the peace
Tryna keep the savage nigga on a leash
'Cause he be tryna eat
And I'm not tryna move, he got ties and I ain't tryna lose
Just tryna find me some room in this room
