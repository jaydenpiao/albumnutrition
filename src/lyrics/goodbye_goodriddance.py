lyrics = '''
I told you to stop fucking calling me
I'm-I told you, I promise you, I can't even talk to you right now, I fuckin' hate you
No, for real, like, stop fucking calling me
I, I will delete you, I will block you
Every fucking time you call me (But I'm, I'm done)
I'm gonna fuckin' block you
You can't fuckin' talk to me no more
On Snapchat (Okay), on Face- I don't wanna hear from you no more (Okay, ayy)
Alright, I'm gonna hang up on you now, okay?
So stop fucking calling me
I said I hate you, stop calling me
Lose my fucking number because I'm done
Is that good?
Uh, I can't yell at a phone (I will fucking block you)
Nigga you ain't gonna-
Nigga, you ain't do shit for me, I promise you
I promise, do you want that?
All the shit I did for you
Okay, alright, how 'bout this big shit like you gon' be something
You not gon' be shit, I promise you
I put that on everything I love, you gon' be stuck where the fuck you're at, and you gon' be wishin' that you knew me
Okay, okay, go ahead talk all that shit now
But who had your back? Me, I did (I did, I did, I did, I did)
They're rotting my brain, love
These hoes are the same
I admit it, another hoe got me finished
Broke my heart, oh no you didn't
Fuck sippin', I'ma down a whole bottle
Hard liquor, hard truth, can't swallow
Need a bartender, put me out my sorrow
Wake up the next day in the Monte Carlo
With a new woman, tell me she from Colorado
And she love women, she'll be gone by tomorrow
Who am I kiddin'?
All this jealousy and agony that I sit in
I'm a jealous boy, really feel like John Lennon
I just want real love, guess it's been a minute
Pissed off from the way that I don't fit in
I don't fit in
Tell me what's the secret to love, I don't get it
Feel like I be runnin' a race I'm not winnin'
Ran into the devil today and she grinnin'
Hey, these girls are insane
All girls are the same
They're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change
Before I go insane, love
All girls are the same
They're rotting my brain, love
Think I need a change
Before I go insane, love
Ten minutes, she tell me it would take ten minutes
To break my heart, oh no she didn't
Fuck livin', I'ma drown in my sorrow
Fuck givin', I'ma take not borrow
And I'm still sinnin', I'm still losin' my mind
I know I been trippin', I'm still wasting my time
All the time given, am I dyin? Am I livin'?
It's fuck feelings, my sorrow go up to the ceilin'
Now I am insane
Demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't obtain
'Cause all these girls the same, love
Now I am insane
Demons in my brain, love
Peace I can't obtain
'Cause all these girls the same, love
No, no, no
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Did this shit in the past
But I want it to last
You were made outta plastic (fake)
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls have the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heart break
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (can't take back the love that I gave you)
You made my heart break (were made outta plastic, fake)
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break again (I was tangled up your drastic ways)
(Who knew evil girls have the prettiest face?)
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you (oh)
Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but
I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
Did this shit in the past but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic (fake)
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls have the prettiest face?
Easier said than done
I thought you were
(Instead of my head, you found another)
I won't let you forget me

That's what she say when she lookin' to find me
Lil' boy I'm your father, hakuna matata
I lick that girl, get up all of that, top her
Got drugs in my head, used to pray for the lock up
I hit from the back and my legs start to lock up
Jacuzzi that booty, I gave that girl flakka
I'm takin' blue caps that keep tweakin' my chakra
Rose my gold chain, there's no hint like no copper
Tats in the middle my head like I'm Avatar
That's the reason that I ride on my Appas

My eyes closed, hopin' this ain't make-believe
And she don't know that all her demons live in me, yeah
I don't know, I don't know
Don't know what she been on, I don't know
All that lean I sip on, now watch me pour it
One cup on me, don't got no friends

She ain't take my heart, but she took my medicine
Least somebody gon' take it, hate to waste it

Drugs got me sweatin', but the room gettin' colder
Lookin' at the devil and the angel on my shoulder
Will I die tonight? I don't know, is it over?
Lookin' for my next high, I'm lookin' for closure
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Told her if I die I'ma die young
Every day I've been gettin' fucked up
Finally know the difference between love and drugs
Shorty tell me I should really sober up
This shit ain't fiction, it's too real, too real
Fuck one dose, I need two pills, two pills
I'm lookin' for trouble so I know I'm gonna find it
Ring, ring, plug hit my phone, perfect timin'
I know I'm not right
But I'm not wrong, no I'm not wrong
Girl, you hate it when I'm too high
But that's where I belong, where I belong
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Eyes red, no Visine
Crashed the Mustang, no Saleen
Yeah, I love P's, yeah, I love lean
I laugh when they ask if my piss clean
Huh, smoke with me, huh, pop with me
Ayy, Gucci store, come and shop with me
If I overdose, bae, are you gon' drop with me?
I don't even wanna think about that right now
Let's get too high, reach a new high
Take the shrooms and the pills at the same time
Went to Hollywood thrills from the street life
Took too many drugs, now I don't feel right
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean with me, pop with me
Get high with me if you rock with me
Smoke with me, drink with me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys (bad kidneys)
Ooh, ooh
Like oh-woah
I'm holding my breath and watching my step
I'm listing regrets, and you made that list
You're my depression, your first impression wasn't deception
You were lyin'
Bitch, I'm still flexin', with my heart broken
Got my heart open, I'm not high yet
Bitch, I'm still moving I'm in slow motion
I wrote my dosage I'm getting higher
Bitch, I still, I still, love my pills, I feel
You can't feel, I feel you can't feel, I feel
Bitch, I still, I still love my pills, I feel
You can't feel, I feel, you can't feel, I feel
Ooh, ooh, oh
Ooh, ooh, oh
Fell in love with your face off the shrooms
The way it animates your eyes in the room
I can see the stars when I'm gazing at you
Now I need the car with the stars in the roof
Elephant all in the room, she buried me in a tomb
I'm feeling over consumed
She walking me to my dorm, I see her face in my room
When I'm alone in the room I'ma blame that on the shrooms
Oh, feeling ridiculed, feeling like a fool, don't know what to do
Lost my heart, don't got shit to lose
I'm holding my breath and watching my step
I'm listing regrets, and you made that list
You're my depression, your first impression wasn't deception
You were lyin'
Bitch, I'm still flexin', with my heart broken
Got my heart open, I'm not high yet
Bitch, I'm still moving I'm in slow motion
I wrote my dosage I'm getting higher
Bitch, I still, I still, love my pills, I feel
You can't feel, I feel you can't feel, I feel
Bitch, I still, I still love my pills, I feel
You can't feel, I feel, you can't feel, I feel
Ooh, ooh, oh
Ooh, ooh, oh
Hello? Oh my God
I know this ain't you calling me again
Oof, ooh my God
Yeah, yeah, it's him
Hello?
What in the fuck did I tell you about calling me?
You found out 'bout who?
Yeah, I bet you did found out about him who
Yeah, I fuck with him, I fuck with him for real
Oh, you mad now?
Nigga, you ain't mad about shit (Girl, pour me another one)
Okay, whatever
I'll talk to you later, okay?
Nah, nah, I ain't even gon' talk to you later
Don't, like I said, delete my number
Why in the fuck is you still calling me?
Why are you pressed about me fucking on him?
I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or if I'm insecure
I'm not sure (yeah, I like that)
Uh, yeah, I'm not sure
I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or if I'm insecure
Baby, you're not her
My last girl had me so fucked up it was a blacked out blur
Baby, you jump first
It's a long way to hell, I ain't really tryna leave this Earth
Baby, do your worst
I've come to the conclusion you can't kill me if I kill you first
I've been through the ringer
Tryna put a diamond ring on her finger
She love drama, she be watching Jerry Springer
Next thing you know, we all on Jerry Springer
I play love games, but no I'm not a cheater
She hate it when I sip codeine, I'm a leaner
The devil on my shoulder keep on telling me to keep her
Should I take her out or should I take her to the cleaner?
Love don't end, good for me, no good for me
She's good for me, too good
These hoes love playing me
Heartbreaking me
Don't pray for me
Just give me drugs
Just give me drugs
Just bring me drugs
Just give me drugs
Yeah, I'm not sure
I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or if I'm insecure
Baby, you're not her
My last girl had me so fucked up it was a blacked out blur
Baby, you jump first
It's a long way to hell, I ain't really tryna leave this Earth
Baby, do your worst
I've come to the conclusion you can't kill me if I kill you first
I told her run around and get away, I think I need a getaway
I need to call a timeout, I need to set another play
I need an umbrella 'cause every day feels like a rainy day
I need something other than Xannies to take the pain away
I ran away to California, I'm tryna cut corners
Satan bossing me around but you know I don't take orders
Yeah, I had to move around I was starting to feel cornered
Starting to feel cornered, I can't see the front door
Starting to feel cornered, starting to feel slaughtered
Started to not give a fuck, screaming out, "why bother"
My ex-bitch too bad, my next bitch way hotter
We met in a car crash, she ride it like full throttle
I'm not sure
I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or if I'm insecure
Baby, you're not her
My last girl had me so fucked up it was a blacked out blur
Baby, you jump first
It's a long way to hell, I ain't really tryna leave this Earth
Baby, do your worst
I've come to the conclusion you can't kill me if I kill you first
Ooh, ooh, woah
I never been scared
I tell you that I don't care
Really I do care
I hope that you care (You know it's Mitch Mula)
I never been scared to love (Drop that bombaclot)
I never been scared of love, scared to love
I'm on the drugs, way too much
I'm not enough, not enough
You're way too much, way too much
Not scared to love just scared of love
Not enough I'm not enough
You're way too much, and I'm not getting enough
You're way too much, still I'm not getting enough
You're way too much, too, too much
The weight is heavy on my shoulders, girl, you're too much
You put my heart in a grave, I get no love
No, I need more drugs, way too much
All I ever do is get fucked up
All I ever wanted was a real love
Got a pint of the lean, I done lucked out
Bros said that it wasn't real mud
Every day I wonder if I can pick my heart out my chest
Lately I been feelin' the worst
So I gotta dress like the best
Moncler all on my chest
VVS all on my neck
Ballin' like a fucking upset
They're beyond stressed
I been hurt but I'm beyond that
I never been scared of love, scared to love
I'm on the drugs, way too much
I'm not enough, not enough
You're way too much, way too much
Not scared to love just scared of love
Not enough I'm not enough
You're way too much, and I'm not getting enough
You're way too much, still not getting enough
We woke up in hell, baby, can't you tell?
As far as I can tell you're the only heaven here
I'm running out of Xans, running out of options
I really need to chill 'fore I'm in a coffin
Way too late, Russian roulette, okay
I know I been dead for a minute now
Ain't wanna be alive, no way
I never been scared of love, scared to love
I'm on the drugs, way too much
I'm not enough, not enough
You're way too much, way too much
Not scared to love just scared of love
Not enough I'm not enough
You're way too much, and I'm not getting enough
You're way too much, still I'm not getting enough

So you just gon' give everything I gave you to somebody else?
You just gon' give me all away like that?

Before the night ends (woah)
Before the night begins
Before the night begins
Before the night begins
Cardo got wings
Now we cookin' up (yeah)
Leave her in the past but I know I'll miss her
I kept all of her paraphernalia
Left her makeup and her panties on my bedroom dresser
Think about the days when I used to undress her
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone
Sorrow and sadness next to me
Old hoes see that I'm mournin' so they textin' me
Ex bitch tryna finesse me, she won't get a damn thing
Listen to my story, it's depressing
Heartbreak mixed with the drugs not the best thing
The devil tryna to test me I'm failing, inhaling
You took it all back
All that heartbreak, that was a year ago
Wanted you back, so bad, but that's
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone
What you don't seem to understand is
You really took my love for granted
You really had me feeling helpless, that's so selfish
Haven't been in love in a long while
Wait until my next girl finds out
Then I'm scared we gon' break up and fall out
Drownin' in my thoughts baby looking for a lighthouse
Ain't no sleep I been feeling like a night owl
Music turnt up, neighbours telling me to pipe down
Oh the other hand, I think I found my future wife
But she not here with me so it get lonely at night, aye
I hope, her love doesn't go away
I hope this ain't a phase
One more heartbreak and I'll be
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone, long gone, long gone
Long gone
Leave her in the past but I know I'll miss her
I kept all of her paraphernalia
Left her makeup and her panties on my bedroom dresser
Think about the days when I used to undress her
This is as far as it goes
This the end of the road
This the end of the rope
The other end at her throat
It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of her show, it's over
We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma
We don't love these hoes, our hearts got colder
It's hard out here for a lonely stoner
I know I'm doin' drugs, but so what
Just pray to God I never throw up
I pray to God my plug can pour up
I pray to God my plug still show up
I know the last time we tried to rob him
He lucky bro and dem ain't fucking off him
I'm drink and driving in the Bentley coupe so
It's hard for me to drive, I move too slow
I told you, baby, I ain't saving no hoe
I only save the money, anti-hero
I burn my old clothes and got some new clothes
I left my old hoes and got some new hoes
My brother got a chopper and it's kickin' like judo
He shootin' while I'm drivin' the two-door
This is as far as it goes
This the end of the road
This the end of the rope
The other end at her throat
It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of the show, it's over
We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma
This is as far as it goes
This the end of the road
This the end of the rope
The other end at her throat
It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of the show, it's over
We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma
I'm smokin' dope 'til I'm in a coma
The moon rock on me, I love the aroma
I get so high that I'm in the clouds with the falling angels
Demons with halos
She love the coke but not Coca-Cola
But she'll still pop it like a soda for ya
Her name rings bells like a Motorola
I lay the bitch off like I'm her employer
And she gon' ride like a rollercoaster
And I'm gon' hide when the love is over
But it's far from over, losing composure
In the coffin, laying stiff like a boulder
This is as far as it goes
This the end of the road
This the end of the rope
The other end at her throat
It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of the show, it's over
We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma
This is as far as it goes
This the end of the road
This the end of the rope
The other end at her throat
It's suicidal she wrote
This is the end of the show, it's over
We doin' drugs 'til we in a coma
And we live
And we recording
And it's lean on it, yuh
Purple Rain
Okay, so
I just popped a bean yesterday, it was a long night
I done did the right drugs, only on the wrong night
I was rocking Off-White, tryna have a fun time
She gon' eat like lunch time, molly got her on time
Fuck niggas don't get respect, but I'ma die about mine
Swervo told me stop popping them Xannies 'fore I flatline
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine
I'ma be fine, I'ma be fine
But in the meantime, bitch, it's lean time
Pop a bean time 'cause it ain't killing me
My lil' bro keep a .40, they thought his ass was security
Too busy making money, to worry 'bout making memories
But in the meantime, bitch, it's green time
Maybe lean time, outta energy
My momma told me, "Stop the painkillers"
Them shits is killing me, I'ma be fine
I just popped a bean yesterday, it was a long night
I done did the right drugs, only on the wrong night
I was rocking Off-White, tryna have a fun time
She gon' eat like lunch time, molly got her on time
Fuck niggas don't get respect, but I'ma die about mine
Swervo told me stop popping them Xannies 'fore I flat line
I said hold on, bro wait I'ma be fine
I'ma be fine, I'ma be fine
They know my name, oh wait
Put it in her mouth just like Colgate
Get outta line and you get punched in your face
Shouldn't have been around here in the first place
Now you got a black eye
I got mob ties, I've got gang ties
Make you drown in your blood, just like high tide
Now I'm up, everybody wanna high five
Remember when they used to diss me in the lunch line
Now I'm eating steak and eggs when it's lunchtime
I remember eating Ramen, with a Glock 9
I remember when she left me for the next guy
Now she calling me her next guy
I just popped a bean yesterday, it was a long night
I done did the right drugs, only on the wrong night
I was rocking Off-White, tryna have a fun time
She gon' eat like lunch time, molly got her on time
Fuck niggas don't get respect, but I'ma die about mine
Swervo told me stop popping them Xannies 'fore I flat line
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine
I said hold on, bro wait, I'ma be fine
I'ma be fine, I'ma be fine
I woke up xanning
I sit down, I can't stand it anymore
Can't stand it anymore
More, oh yeah
I woke up leaning
So I woke up dreaming
And feening for more
For more
For more
One cup, I need four more
Hey, I woke up leaning
So I woke up dreaming
And feening for more
For more
For more
One cup, I need four more
Hey!
