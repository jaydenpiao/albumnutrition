lyrics = '''
Take off my disguise
I'm living someone else's life
Suppressing who I was inside
So I throw two-thousand ones in the sky
Together we're alone (together we're alone)
In Vegas I feel so at home (in Vegas I feel so at home)
Falling only for the night
So I throw two-thousand ones in the sky (the sky)
How, how much to light up my star again
And rewire all my thoughts?
Oh baby, won't you remind me what I am?
And break, break my little cold heart
Call me up and I'll send for you
Take me down to your altitude
I don't know if I can be alone again
I don't know if I can sleep alone again (alone again)
Check my pulse for a second time (second time)
I took too much, I don't wanna die
I don't know if I can be alone again
I don't know if I can sleep alone again
Count it up, it's all for you, count it up
Count it up, it's all for you, count it up
I don't know if I can be alone again
I don't know if I can be alone again (alone again)
No-no, no-no, no-no-no
I let you down, I led you on
I never thought I'd be here without you
Don't let me drown inside your arms
Bad thoughts inside my mind
When the darkness comes, you're my light, baby
My light, baby, my light when it's dark, yeah
I'm too high, baby, too high, baby
'Cause I know right now, that I lost it (hey)
It's way too late to save our souls, baby (oh, oh, yeah)
It's way too late, we're on our own (baby, on my own)
I made mistakes, I did you wrong, baby (oh, oh, yeah)
It's way too late to save my
I can't trust (I can't trust) where I live (where I live)
Anymore (anymore, anymore, anymore)
Sources say that we're done, how would they know?
We're in hell, it's disguised as a paradise with flashing lights
I just wanna believe there's so much more (hey, woo, hey, woo, hey)
It's way too late to save our souls, baby (oh, oh, yeah)
It's way too late, we're on our own (baby, on my own)
I made mistakes, I did you wrong, baby (oh, oh, yeah)
It's way too late to save my
And, ooh, I tell myself I should get over you
I said ooh, I know I'd rather be all over you
I'm trying, trying, but I, I just want your body
Riding slow on top of me, girl, on top of me
I want you, babe, ooh-ooh
It's way too late (late) to save our souls
Baby (souls, baby, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
It's way too late, we're on our own (baby, on my own)
I made mistakes (mistakes), I did you wrong, baby (oh, oh, yeah)
It's way too late to save my
No, oh
Oh, yeah
Yeah, uh
You try with me so many times
You're cryin' out behind the smiles
And I can see right through the lies
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And what we had is dead inside, yeah
You're actin' like it's still alive
And you still wanna make it right, yeah
I know
But I've been the hardest to love
You're tryna let me go, yeah
And I can see it, I can see it
I've been the hardest to love
It's hard to let me go, yeah
And I can feel it, I can feel it (oh, yeah)
I don't feel it anymore (yeah)
The house I bought is not a home (no)
Together we are so alone
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (oh)
Don't regret the day we met (we met)
Don't forget that time we spent (we spent)
Forget that we're in different beds
I know
'Cause I've been the hardest to love
You're tryna let me go, yeah
And I can see it, I can see it
I've been the hardest to love
It's hard to let me go, yeah
And I can feel it, I can feel it
I can't, can't believe you want me (oh)
After all the heart breaks (oh), after all I've done
Oh-oh-oh (oh, oh, oh)
No, I can't, can't believe you trust me (trust me)
After all the rough days
You still call me up (me up, oh-oh-oh)
'Cause I've been the hardest to love
You're tryna let me go (tryna let me go), yeah
And I can see it, I can see it (I can see it)
I've been the hardest to love (love, baby)
You're tryna let me go, yeah
And I can feel it, I can feel it
When I saw the signs, I shoulda let you go
But I kept you beside me
And if I held you back, at least I held you close (yeah)
Should have known you were lonely
I know things will never be the same
Time we lost will never be replaced
I'm the reason you forgot to love
So don't be scared to live again
Be scared to live again
No, don't be scared to live again
Be scared to live again
You always miss the chance to fall for someone else (someone else)
'Cause your heart only knows me
They try to win your love, but there was nothing left (nothing left)
They just made you feel lonely (oh)
I am not the man I used to be
Did some things I couldn't let you see
Refused to be the one who taints your heart
So don't be scared to live again
Be scared to live again
No, don't be scared to live again, baby
Be scared to live again (oh)
I hope you know that (oh), I hope you know that (oh)
I'll be praying that you find yourself
I hope you know that (oh), I hope you know that (oh)
We fell apart right from the start
I should have made you my only
When it's said and done
So don't be scared to live again
Be scared to live again
I said, don't be scared to live again
Be scared to live again (oh)
I hope you know that (oh), I hope you know that (oh)
I'll be praying that you find yourself
I hope you know that (oh), I hope you know that (oh)
We fell apart right from the start
I used to pray when I was sixteen
If I didn't make it then I'd probably make my wrist bleed
Not to mislead, turn my nightmares into big dreams
Whole squad mobbin' even though we only six deep
I was singing notes while my niggas played with six keys
Walking in the snow before I ever made my wrist freeze
I was blowing smoke, had me dizzy like Gillespie
Niggas had no homes we were living in the dead streets
You couldn't find me like I'm Hoffa
Cover girls jumping out the page like they pop ups
Spending all my money on these niggas that I brought up
Taking care of families for my brothers when they locked up
And I had nothing to believe in
Double cup leanin'
Couldn't even breathe and
For that money I was fiending
Cali was the mission but now a nigga leaving
Leaving, leaving into the night (into the night, into the night)
Now a nigga leaving, leaving
Leaving into the night
She like my futuristic sounds in the new spaceship
Futuristic sex give her Phillip K dick
She never need a man, she what a man need (man need)
So I keep on falling for her daily (daily)
We was at Coachella going brazy
Stack a couple M's like I was Shady (I was Shady)
Now I'm in Tribeca like I'm Jay-Z (Jay-Z)
Rockin' Sorayama like he pay me (pay me)
I just signed a new deal with Mercedes ('Cedes)
Got me movin' dirty like I'm Swayze (Swayze)
All my diamonds dancing like they Swayze (Swayze)
All my diamonds hitting like they Swae Lee (Swae Lee)
Jet so big got a business and a coach
Always livin' on the road, rockin' Louis a la mode, nigga
And for that money I been fiending
Cali was the mission but now a nigga leaving
Leaving, leaving into the night (into the night, into the night)
Now a nigga leaving, leaving
Leaving into the night, oh
Twenty mill' mansion, never lived in it (lived in it)
Zero edge pool, never dipped in it (dipped in it)
Superstar neighbor in my business (in my business, in my business)
Paparazzi tryna catch me slippin' (slippin')
Going on tour is my vacation (my vacation)
Every month another accusation (accusation)
Only thing I'm phobic of is failing (failing)
I was never blessed with any patience
So a nigga leaving, leaving, leaving into the night
Now a nigga leaving, leaving
Leaving into the night, oh
You pillow talk to me about the men who try to get in between us
They buy you bags and jewelry, yeah
They think your kindness is so weak
Know you don't give it up so easy, baby
But you just wanted my attention
You just wanted my affection
You got me tattooed on your mind
You just want me all the time
We'll figure out our shit and find a way (oh, yeah)
When you say that you need space, I give you space (you space)
Girl, when you're ready, you know where I stay
When it comes to all these hoes, I'll never chase
But this world is such a, such an evil place
Man, these hoes will always find a way
'Cause when I'm on the liquor, I go crazy
And for that pussy, you know I'm a slave, yeah
Well this place is never what it seems
Take me out, LA
Take me out of LA
This place will be the end of me
Take me out, LA
Take me out of LA, yeah
Yeah
I'm in the Spyder Porsche cruisin' down the street
Black on black venom colored seats
Keanu Reeves, the way a nigga speed
Diamond cross hangin' off of me
I'm fighting for my soul, Constantine
And it's slowly burning, it was never cheap
If you see what I seen, you wouldn't sleep
I can't sleep
'Cause I got everything I wanted
Got the money, got the cars, got the ceiling with the stars
Got everything I wanted
But I'd be nothing without you
Gave you everything you wanted
Gave you power, gave you life, gave you space so you can shine
Gave you everything you wanted
But none of that matters to you, oh-oh
This place (this place) is never what it seems
Take me out, LA
Take me out of LA (take me out, LA)
This place will be the end of me (oh, whoa-oh)
Take me out, LA (take me out of it)
Take me out of LA, yeah
Whoa, no, oh, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, ooh-whoa
Oh-ah, no, no, no, no, whoa-whoa
Oh, no, oh
She pulled up to the studio
Nobody's watching
She closed the door and then she locked it
For me, for me
We had sex in the studio
Nobody walked in
I cut my verse and then she popped it
For me, for me
LA girls all look the same
I can't recognize
The same work done on their face
I don't criticize
She a cold-hearted bitch with no shame
But her throat too fire
She got Chrome Hearts hangin' from her neck
And them shits going wild
When she ride, she hold tight
She gon' ride 'til sweat fall down her spine
She's all mine for the night
She's all mine until he calls her line
She pulled up to the studio
Nobody's watching
She closed the door and then she locked it
For me, for me
We had sex in the studio
Nobody walked in
I cut my verse and then she popped it
For me, for me
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Never need a bitch, I'm what a bitch need
Tryna find the one that can fix me
I've been dodging death in the six-speed
Amphetamine got my stummy feeling sickly
Yeah, I want it all now
I've been running through the pussy, need a dog pound
Hundred models getting faded in the compound
Trying to love me but they never get a pulse down
'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this fame got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man but I'm heartless
Never be a wedding plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
So much pussy, it be falling out the pocket
Metro Boomin, turn this hoe into a mosh pit
Tesla pill got me flying like a cockpit
Yeah, I gotta watch it
Call me up, turn that pussy to a faucet
Duffel bags full of drugs and a rocket
Stix drunk but he never miss a target
Photoshoots, I'm a star now
I'm talkin' Time, Rolling Stone and Bazaar now
Selling dreams to these girls with they guard down
Seven years I been swimming with the sharks now
'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this fame got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man but I'm heartless
Never be a wedding plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
I lost my heart and my mind
I tried to always do right
I thought I lost you this time
You just came back in my life
You never gave up on me (why don't you?)
I'll never know what you see (why won't you?)
I don't do well when alone (oh, yeah)
You hear it clear in my tone
'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man but I'm heartless
Never be a wedding plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Light a blunt up with the flame (light a blunt up with the flame)
Put that cocaine on a plate (put that cocaine on a plate)
Molly with the purple rain (molly with the purple rain)
'Cause I lost my faith
So I cut away the pain, uh (so I cut away the pain)
Got it swimming in my veins (got it swimming in my veins)
Now my mind is outta place, yeah, uh (now my mind is outta place, yeah)
'Cause I lost my faith
And I feel everything
I feel everything from my body to my soul
No, no
Well, I feel everything
When I'm coming down is the most I feel alone
No, no
I've been sober for a year, now it's time for me
To go back to my old ways, don't you cry for me
Thought I'd be a better man, but I lied to me and to you
I take half a Xan' and I still stay awake (stay awake)
All my demons wanna pull me to my grave (to my grave)
I choose Vegas if they offer heaven's gate (heaven's gate)
I tried to love, but you know I'd never stay (you know I'd never stay)
I'd never stay
But if I OD, I want you to OD right beside
I want you to follow right behind me
I want you to hold me while I'm smiling
While I'm dying
And if you know me
When I go missing, you know where to find me
Driving down the boulevard is blinding
Always blinded by the desert lights and
I'm alive when
I feel everything
I feel everything from my body to my soul
No, no
Girl, I feel everything
When I'm coming down is the most I feel alone
No, no
I lost my faith (I lost my faith)
I'm losing my religion every day
Time hasn't been kind to me, I pray (I pray)
When I look inside the mirror and see someone I love
Oh, someone I love
Faith (Faith)
I'm losing my religion every day (every day, every day)
Time hasn't been kind to me, I pray (I pray)
When I look inside the mirror and see someone I love
Oh, someone I love
I ended up in the back of a flashing car
With the city shining on my face
The lights are blinding me again
I ended up in the back of a flashing car
With the city shining on my face
The lights are blinding me again
I ended up (I ended up)
In the back of a flashing car (back of a flashing car)
Yeah
I been tryna call
I been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm going through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby
I look around and Sin City's cold and empty (oh)
No one's around to judge me (oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey
I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby
Oh, the city's cold and empty (oh)
No one's around to judge me (oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
I'm just walking by to let you know (by to let you know)
I can never say it on the phone (say it on the phone)
Will never let you go this time (ooh)
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
Oh, yeah
I just pretend that I'm in the dark
I don't regret 'cause my heart can't take a loss
I'd rather be so oblivious
I'd rather be with you
When it's said, when it's done, yeah
I don't ever wanna know
I can tell what you done, yeah
When I look at you
In your eyes
I see there's something burning inside you
Oh, inside you
In your eyes
I know it hurts to smile but you try to
Oh, you try to
You always try to hide the pain
You always know just what to say
I always look the other way
I'm blind, I'm blind
In your eyes, you lie, but I don't let it define you
Oh, define you
I tried to find love
In someone else too many times
But I hope you know I mean it (mean it)
When I tell you you're the one that was on my mind, oh
When it's said, when it's done, yeah
I would never let you know (let you know)
I'm ashamed of what I've done, yeah
When I look at you
In your eyes (your eyes)
I see there's something burning inside you (inside you)
Oh, inside you (oh, inside you)
In your eyes
I know it hurts to smile but you try to (but you try to)
Oh, you try to (I try to)
You always try to hide the pain (oh, oh)
You always know just what to say (oh, dear)
I always look the other way
I'm blind, I'm blind
In your eyes, you lie, but I don't let it define you (hey)
Oh, define you
In your eyes
I see there's something burning inside you
Oh, inside you
You always try to hide the pain
You always know just what to say
I always look the other way
I'm blind, I'm blind
In your eyes, you lie, but I don't let it define you
Oh, define you
Ooh
Na-na, yeah
I saw you dancing in a crowded room
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye
I don't know why I run away
I'll make you cry when I run away
You could've asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care
I don't know why I run away
I'll make you cry when I run away
Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day
So, I made you think that I would always stay
I said some things that I should never say
Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
And now you won't love me for a second time
I don't know why I run away, oh, girl
Said I'll make you cry when I run away
Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I realize that I'm much too late
And you deserve someone better
Save your tears for another day (ooh, yeah)
Save your tears for another day (yeah)
I don't know why I run away
I'll make you cry when I run away
Save your tears for another day, ooh, girl (ah)
I said save your tears for another day (ah)
Save your tears for another day (ah)
Save your tears for another day (ah)
You don't love him, you don't love him
You don't love him if you're thinking of me
You don't love him, you're just fucking
You're just fucking, it means nothing to me
You don't love him, you don't love him
You don't love him if you're thinking of me
You don't love him, you're just fucking
You're just fucking, it means nothing to me, yeah
It's been too long, you changed up over time
Why you, why you gonna even try to hide?
It's natural to find someone to treat you right
But it ain't right if you fuck him out of spite
You don't have to cry, girl, let me wipe your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
I promise you will always be mine
Oh-oh, just repeat after me
You don't love him, you don't love him
You don't love him if you're thinking of me (it's all right)
You don't love him, you're just fucking
You're just fucking, you're thinking of me
You don't love him, you don't love him
You don't love him if you're thinking of me
You don't love him, you're just fucking
You're just fucking, it means nothing to me
Thought I almost died in my dream again (baby, almost died)
Fightin' for my life, I couldn't breathe again
I'm fallin' in too deep (oh)
Without you, don't wanna sleep (fallin' in)
'Cause my heart belongs to you
I'll risk it all for you
I want you next to me
This time, I'll never leave
I wanna share babies
Protection, we won't need
Your body next to me
Is just a memory
I'm fallin' in too deep, oh
Without you, I can't sleep
It's on me, all on me, oh
Talk to me, without you I can't breathe
My darkest hours
Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room
Different girls on the floor, distracting my thoughts of you
I turned into the man I used to be, to be
Put myself to sleep
Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams
Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me
I just wanted to call you and say, and say
Oh, baby, where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
Never comin' down, uh
I was runnin' away from facin' reality
Wastin' all of my time on livin' my fantasies
Spendin' money to compensate, compensate
'Cause I want you baby
I'll be livin' in Heaven when I'm inside of you
It was definitely a blessing, wakin' beside you
I'll never let you down again, again
Oh, baby, where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
I said, baby, I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go
This time I won't break your heart, your heart, yeah
I know it's all my fault
Made you put down your guard
I know I made you fall
They said you were wrong for me
I lied to you, I lied to you, I lied to you (to you)
Can't hide the truth, I stayed with her in spite of you
You did some things that you regret, still ride for you
'Cause this house is not a home
Without my baby, where are you now when I need you most?
I gave it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
And I said, baby, I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go
This time I won't break your heart, your heart, no
I can't move, I'm so paralyzed
I'm so paralyzed
I can't explain why I'm terrified
I'm so terrified
Well, I don't wanna touch the sky no more
I just wanna feel the ground when I'm coming down
It's been way too long
And I don't even wanna get high no more
Just want it out of my life
Out of my life, out
I wanna cut you outta my dreams
'Til I'm bleeding out
'Til I'm bleeding
I wanna cut you outta my mind
'Til I'm bleeding out
'Til I'm bleeding
I wanna cut you outta my dreams
Whoa, I'm bleeding out
Girl, I'm bleeding
I wanna cut you outta my mind
'Cause I'm bleeding out
Oh, I'm bleeding
Girl, I'm bleeding
I keep telling myself I don't need it
I keep telling myself I don't need it anymore
I keep telling myself I don't need it anymore
Need it anymore
