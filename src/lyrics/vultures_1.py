lyrics = '''
I hope he's bright and big, and strong
I hope he's bright and big, and strong
You already know what I'm on
Tell 'em don't wait up for me
Pullin' up, drop top Porsche
This that glory
I'ma come through and just black out
Just black out
Keep a few jews on the staff now
I cash out
We finna go where the stars at
And beyond that
This that rip up the contract
Fuck all that
I ain't gotta ask nobody
Plug talk, plug talk, shawty
And she wanna back it up for me
I'ma blow your back out, shawty (oh-oh)
Got a hundred racks in the morning (oh-oh)
Woo-ooh, woo-ooh, woo-ooh
(I hope he's bright and big, and strong)
I ain't gotta ask nobody
Plug talk, plug talk, shawty
And she wanna back it up for me
I'ma blow your back out, shawty (oh-oh)
Got a hundred racks in the morning (oh-oh)
Woo-ooh, woo-ooh, woo-ooh
I hope he's bright and big, and strong
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
I hope he's bright and big, and strong
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
And we'll be way up in the stars

Slow down
Slow down, you on your way to an overdose
Plus, these texts gettin' way too emoji-nal
Way too much time alone
Told the guys that you know I'm headed home, I got a trauma bond
Look at what I stumbled on
Another nigga chillin' on your couch with pajamas on
Thought I was the only one
How dare you have a nigga in your house eatin' Papa Johns?
Where you get that money from?
Lookin' at how far we come, I bought your first Vacheron
Guess we had an awesome run
Ever since I lost my mom, you was like my foster mom
Hold me like your only son
Hold me like the homies in the Chi' when they hold they guns
Hold me like a trophy in the sky when they know they won
Wasn't it always this way?
Wasn't it always this way?
Puttin' it all on display
Usin' up all your sick days
Put up with all my mistakes
Listen to all my mixtapes
'Posed to be always this way
'Posed to be always this way
Couldn't it all be so simple?
I could've used that last part for the intro
How it sound when you got Yeezy over Timbo?
From Uptown, but now she rockin' Yeezys over Timbos
Like you don't see me beatin' on your window
Like Chief Keef in the kitchen with the BDs and the endo
But that was me when I was burnin' CDs for my friends though
Now, I can't just take it on the chin like Jay Leno
Now, everybody want the info
These bitches want the pin code, these niggas swear we kinfolk
In a Benzy with a Gen-Z gettin' gentle
If I gotta pay for it, I'ma drive it like a rental
You already know my M.O.
Is you ready for the Venmo? You already know my demo
You already know I'm impulsive
And another baby is my end goal
I wanna give you keys to my life, to my life, to my life, uh
I wanna give you keys to my life, to my life, to my life, yeah (ah-hahahaha)
I wanna give you keys to my life, to my life, to my life, yeah

Cut Wock' and the cost is 15
Life flew past too fast
Old stomach is the new ass
He can't afford you, that's too bad
Told her what you gon' do with a durag?
Fuck the lame, do you write down the names?
You was stuck, run in place
You ain't runnin' with the strays no more
Roxanne, you don't have to put on
Yeah, I got that shit on
Give me somethin' to spit on
Roxanne, you don't have to stop at the red light

Dollars all she do it for

How much to stop the clock from speedin'?
They might try to slow down
How much to stop my daughter from growin'?
I just can't take it now
'Cause she just doin' all the shit I did when I was her age
I don't know how I'm gonna tell her, but her dad's just afraid
Of her choices, know that I've been through it
I just hope I haven't been the wrong influence
Put her on game before the world put her through it
Ooh-oh, oh-oh, oh
That's why I gotta break the curses that were sent for me
This is hard work workin', this ain't destiny
My motivation is just lookin' at my family tree
I'm tryna make sure I contribute for the legacy
Once again the clouds are gathering to release what they held in (oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
(Once again, once, on-, on-, on-, once again, once, ag-again)
Once again
Once again the clouds are gathering to release what they held in (oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)

Forgis on the Double R, I'm floatin' like a cruise line
Bitches wanna fuck me, then trap me, then fuck me over
She cryin' tears in that Maybach and not the Toyota

Suck my dick for the interview, a headitorial
Put you on a track, have you workin' like I appointed you
Hoe, how you gon' go blockin' your blessing when I anointed you?
Beautiful big titty, butt naked bitches, where you at? Uh
Started off trippin', tell her, "Pay tuition, " no congrats, uh
Winin' and dinin', now to take my ratchet hoe to Saks, uh
She was too used to Hamburger Helper, chili mac
And that's facts, you can fact-check it
I'm from the crack era
Redbone bitches, they king me like I'm a black checker
Standin' at the plate, your hoe catchin' balls like a bat catcher
I bring my pistol when I fuck her 'cause it's all 'bout survival, hoe
I'll gut you clean, I bet you fuck with my rivals, though
Put that on everything, a whole a stack of bibles, hoe
Real niggas like me just don't fall out the sky, you know

You look like a piece of hallelujah
Wrapped up in, have mercy, Lord
I know that I've got a nice whip
But I hope that me and you could be on one accord
I shot, I scored (ah, ma', what up?)
I take it off the board, headboard
Ah, boom, nigga (nigga, ah, ma', what up?)
She fell in love with the sword
I sliced, I diced, I hit it from the back
Whore, whore (ah, ma', what up?)
But I respect your feelings
When your toes tried to touch the ceiling havin' safe sex (auntie)
Of course, unlock the door, bought all the things that you could dream of
Had I bought a Chanel, Gucci, Pucci creamer
But we all know the outcome that fucked up the income
And then some have mercy, Lord
A nigga eyes on dim sum, let the light dim some
Catch me on your TV, heart broke GD
You look like a piece of hallelujah
Wrapped up in, have mercy, Lord
I know that I've got a nice whip
But I hope that me and you could be on one accord (nigga)
One maker, real breath taker, real rump shaker
Do that, whip what her mama gave her
911, let me call my savior
Jesus on the main line, brand new T-shirt (ah, ma' what up?)
Don't make me stain mine
Drank so much, she throwin' up my gang sign
Throwin' up my gang sign

People are funny, they know, Kanye's great too
But the way he conducts himself, they hate to believe it
But they can't help it, they know he's great (right)
Why would-? Listen, the shit Kanye say is basically
Affirmations' what people say for success
And it sounds insane, because that's what motherfuckers do
But he sounds insane and that's sounds of a leader
No doubt he's got some mental fuckin' issues, most leaders do
The delusional issue, "I'm a God"

Do it stay waxed? Do it smell fresh?
Can I feel your juice through the latex?
If you go 'round and you stay wet

To who it may concern, the CEO of the firm

Man, a couple wrong turns

You charging for cookie, that's bang for your buck
If you kissin' on the mouth, you ain't charging enough

Boys, I need you to give me somethin' big, I'm talkin' 'bout dollar signs
Skinny pants flow, tell the hoe "No, I don't wanna fuck"
She can suck-suck-suck it, 'til she suck it dry

Badass bitch from the Middle E-E-E-E-East wanna lick on me
Stick on me, even though I got security
Even though she got a man, she know he ain't as pure as me, seriously

Couple grey hairs up in my beard, that's showin' my maturity, yeah

Dolla done rather be fuckin' it up
Still screamin' "Free TC, Melly, and Thug"
Fuck the police, the DA and the judge
Way out in Saudi, I found me a plug
Don't wanna go out, she'd rather do drugs
Can't be my main if we met in the club
Give me somethin', bitch, I'm talkin' 'bout dollar signs
Look it here, hoe, I don't wanna fuck
Here's a buck, but a buck, buck, buck
I'm shootin', game to light that-

You've gone too far
You've gone too far, and you should hang your head in shame
For these wounds, I cannot stay
You've gone too far
You've gone too far
Wide awake and I can hear my heartbeat
Hope it cradles me and rocks my heart to sleep
Protector in the light and a stranger in the dark
And you don't say anything more
Bound by suffocating secrets I must keep
You've gone too far
You've gone too far, and you should hang your head in shame
For these wounds, I cannot stay
You've gone too far
You've gone too far
Sum of all the parts that you have taken
Are a fraction of the parts that make me whole
For he was stronger than I was
But it's strength you can't sustain
Do not come to give me counsel
You should beg forgiveness of me
You should beg forgiveness
You should beg forgiveness
You should beg forgiveness
You should beg forgiveness of me
Wide awake and I can hear my heartbeat
Hope it cradles me and rocks my heart to sleep
Protector in the light and a stranger in the dark
And you don't say anything more
Bound by suffocating secrets I must keep
You've gone too far
You've gone too far, and you should hang your head in shame
For these wounds, I cannot stay
You've gone too far
You've gone too far
Sum of all the parts that you have taken
Are a fraction of the parts that make me whole
For he was stronger than I was
But it's strength you can't sustain
Do not come to give me counsel
You should beg forgiveness of me
You should beg forgiveness
You should beg forgiveness
You should beg forgiveness
You should beg forgiveness of me
Fuck it up one time
I know what you want
I'm readin' the signs
Don't let your moment pass you by
Don't let your moment pass you by
Had to go in my whole life
A hundred percent covered in ice
Put down your phone, cut off the lights
Lights
Cut off the lights
Covered in ice
And if I go tonight, know that I lived a lovely life
Just make sure my kids are right and it is alright
And if I go tonight, just know I lived a lovely life
Tell my kids to live they life how they wanna live they life
Beg forgiveness
Beg forgiveness
Beg forgiveness
Beg forgiveness
Beg forgiveness
Beg forgiveness

Beg forgiveness
Beg forgiveness

Say you wanna make amends before I go
Now you wanna put your heart on the line
God knows the way you are
I will wait
I will wait, I will wait
I will wait, I will wait
I will wait, I will wait
I will wait, I will wait
I will wait, don't wait
I will wait, I will wait
I will wait
I will wait
Now you wanna be so sad
Wanna be with me so bad
After driving me so mad
Yeah, you know
I'm still suffocating on your every lie
Yeah, you know
I'm still wakin' up with murder on my mind
Yeah, you know
I'm still suffocating on your every lie
Yeah, you know
I'm still wakin' up with murder on my mind
And you know
Beg forgiveness (oh-ah-ah)

Ooh, I'm alive, I'm alive
I'm alive, I'm alive, ooh, hmm
In the dark of night
These thoughts of mine
Keep me up all night
Got my heart on ice
Don't die, don't die
Ooh, I'm alive, I'm alive
I'm alive, I'm alive, ooh, hmm
On this hopeless night
Came a thousand miles to see you smile tonight
Your smile tonight
Oh, smile for me tonight (ooh)
Got my heart on ice
Don't die, don't die
Ooh, I'm alive, I'm alive
I'm alive, I'm alive, ooh, hmm
Just one more time
Don't die, don't die, please
In the dark of night
These thoughts of mine
Keep me up all night
Got my heart on ice
Don't die, don't die
Ooh, I'm alive, I'm alive
I'm alive, I'm alive, ooh, hmm
On this hopeless night
Came a thousand miles to see you smile tonight
Your smile tonight
Oh, smile for me tonight (ooh)
Got my heart on ice

Ooh, I'm alive, I'm alive
I'm alive, I'm alive, ooh, hmm
Just one more time
Don't die, don't die, (ooh) please
Don't die, don't die
Don't die, don't die

I feel like I beat a murder, murder
Fuckin' on a bitch you never heard of, heard of
That Pope like the leader of the Vati-can, he do it again?
Everything I do, they do, guess Yeezy set the trend
And we in this bitch again, time to get rich again
(Throw your motherfuckin' hands)
They lookin' like prey, I guess that's why they praying
And when you flyin' private, it can't be no delayin'
When I speak my mind
It's gon' be some lawsuits and furniture movin'
I gotta haul through, like when you be movin'
I gotta fly to Japan just to be secluded
They did no damage, what I give 'em? No chances
Even if they get a chance, here's panic like they know Spanish
How I brand all of these clothes?
How every tantrum I throw make an anthem for hoes?
This my life, not a quote
I feel like I beat a murder, murder
Fuckin' on a bitch you never heard of, heard of
I'ma take all my baldies to Giorgio Baldi's, throw my dick a party
Your dress code upscale
Used to shop at ALDI's
I ran up some numbers, now I got what you all need
Give your homegirl the boric acid, save the summer
New abs, she dropping fast, it's time to come up
Blackout
Passin' out and then she wakin' up gorgeous
I'm not racist, it's a preference
And my bitch lookin' like a reference
Throw them, make them moves like a referee
Come get on your knees, shawty, I got needs
She a loud mouth
I need to sign a seal, a couple brand-new deals
Gotta get this shit off my chest, I got some shit to spill
Passin' out NDA's, Nigga Deal with it After
I just fucked the world raw, she need a morning after
And in the morning after
And I quote, "It's only one goat", let you had your fun though
Run the block like Mutombo, you had it on loan
Every day in New Jersey, on my way to New York
I was late to every meeting in my Queens tunnel
But all the hoes in Hoboken know
If I sent you outside with the open-toes
You might get you a trip to the Poconos
You might have to tell your man a Pinocchio
That was a jokey-joke
That wasn't nowhere near as funny when you brokey-broke
Cryin' in high school over a high school bitch
And she still in the dark takin' night school, bitch
Look at how we made it like we Mike Will bitch
Wish somebody woulda warned us
When I was 15, my soulmate wasn't born yet
African king in a different time
We got multiple wives too, just at different times
Picture this, if every room got a different bitch
Do that make me a po-nigga-mist?
Without the deals, I guarantee I'm still nigga rich
Shit is fucking ridiculous

After everything said, huh, man, man
After everything said, huh, man, man
"Crazy, bipolar, antisemite"
And I'm still the king
Still the king, still the-
They thought headlines was my kryptonite
Still the king, still the king
It's what y'all all been waitin' for, huh?
Guess a real nigga couldn't take no more, huh
Niggas mad 'cause they can't talk to Ye no more, huh
It was FucksGivin' now it ain't no more, huh
If you ain't mean it, what you say it for, huh?
She just wanna fuck at the Bottega store, huh
When she suck me off, I should be payin' more, huh
I take her to my bitch 'cause she actin' like a slut
Bring four sluts right now
Shut the Hell up 'fore you get exiled
And, I'm still, "Crazy, bipolar, antisemite"
And I'm still the king
They thought headlines was my kryptonite, bitch
I'm still the king, I'm still the king
Paparazzi love me, they show up to everything
I can pay you double, let me put you on the team
White castle to entire castles, we did everything
Sold out every stadium that we got every week
I don't give a - Uh-uh, ooh
Why do the king?
All that word of mouth couldn't take me out, huh?
After all of that, your kids in the house goin' crazy
'Cause I'm still the king
Still the king
Still the king
Deadlines, I gave a shit, like-
Still the king
Still the king
