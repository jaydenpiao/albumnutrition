lyrics = '''
I turned to an addict, I bought me a Patek
I bought her a baby one
Yeah, I bought me a Maybach, it came with two doors
Yeah, that's the Mercedes one (for sure)
I stay with the baddest, I'm countin' the cabbage
While makin' my lady cum (yeah)
I bought a G-Wagen, that shit was the BRABUS
That's why I be racin' em (BRABUS)
Yeah, we bought the four-door, had to get ready for war
Yeah, we bought the four-door, had to get ready for war (go get it)
Yeah, we bought the four-door, had to get ready for war (go get it)
Yeah, we bought the four-door, had to get ready for war
I got static in my city, who fuckin' with me?
Pull up with this 30 and this chopper hold a fifty
Man, I heard that nigga Mickey, that's too risky
Man, we spray his car, spray his window, icky, icky
She keep suckin' on my dick, tryna get a hickey, hickey
Girl, I swear that pussy too wet, sticky, sticky
I kicked her right out of the front door, I'm picky, picky
Yeah, and every time she go to call my phone
I'm busy, busy (yeah, yeah, hello, hello? Hello?)
I heard it's some niggas that's on my head
I heard it's some niggas that want my bread
Oh my God
Y'all niggas better chill before y'all all be dead (oh my God, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Whole lot of, whole lot of hoes, whole lot of, whole lot of meds
Yeah, whole lot of, whole lot of clothes, niggas be stealin' my swag (hold up)
Whole lot of, whole of emeralds, please tuck your baguettes
Yeah, whole lot of, whole lot of red rubies on my neck
Uzi, it came with a TEC
The brick, it came with a vet
I can teach you how to flex (yes)
The Draco, it came with a vest
The condo, it came with a pit
My new bitch, she came with some neck (yeah)
Man, these boys ain't believe me
Until I pulled up and my neck was on squeegee (whoa)
Man, these boys ain't believe me
They thought I believed in the devil like ouija
Man, these boys ain't believe me
A real rockstar, Chrome Heart on my beanie (yeah)
I swear these boys cannot see me
That's why I be livin' my life like I'm Stevie
Wake up, Versace my bitch
I got on that Tisci, I eat fettuccine
I turned to an addict, I bought me a Patek
I bought her a baby one
Yeah, I bought me a Maybach, it came with two doors
Yeah, that's the Mercedes one (for sure)
I stay with the baddest, I'm countin' the cabbage

I bought a G-Wagen, that shit was the BRABUS
That's why I be racin' em (I bought a G-Wagen)
Yeah, we bought the four-door, had to get ready for war (yeah)
I ain't fuck a bitch in so long, I'll do it in the Honda Accord (no cap)
I had to count my money on the ironing board
I just took that bitch shoppin', fucked behind the stores
I had to get all my niggas off bond
I had to get 'em off holding (yeah)
I had to take 12 right on the mile, drive it like my van was stolen (skrrt, skrrt)
It sing like my birthday, brand new
'Cause I'm only known just to floor it
Yeah, I just know they be watchin' it
Yeah, yeah, I just know they be watchin'
All these hoes love me
I am such a slimy guy, nigga, do not trust me
Baby, I'ma bust you way before you bust me
You shouldn't have trusted me, girl, you got off lucky (yeah)
If it's beef, don't partake

Yo, what the fuck was that?
Yeah, chopstick came with a large lo mein
Extra clip in it, nigga, I ain't got no aim
Balmain pocket filled with fresh romaine
And I stay with the cash like a XO chain
Fifty-five hundred, nigga, that's your rain?
When I go to the club, make it storm, hurricane (yeah)
Nigga pull up, think he G.I. Joe
Man, 7.62, turn him G.I. Jane
It's that Rick Owen boot, they be knee-high, man
Now when I look down you know I can't see my ankle
Man, she asked for some racks gave her three times ten
Put her right in the condo, put her in the Benz
And I did all of that, don't wanna see her again
And honestly on to better things, that's her friend
These niggas groupies, they peons, man
King of my city like Leon, man
'Head of these niggas by eons, man
She let me touch for the freon, man
So you know that's a must like Elon, man
They was hatin', I was spendin', you was savin'
Man, I'm countin' up green like a pea pod, man
I was holdin' down my team like my name was Peyton
Had to make sure my brother good, Eli Manning
Cartier's got diamonds all in the middle
Like a nigga pulled up with three eyes, man
Just know them shits, they all G.I., man
Everybody got Rollies, that's two time frame
I said my side girl tryna be my main
And I said my main girl keep stalkin' my side

Just like a bird she gonna swoop
Neck is achoo, might catch the flu
Banana clip, straight from the zoo
I'm like, Mother Goose, if I say shoot
They're gonna shoot
No I'm not sweet, I just got flavor
Don't need no water to mix up this juice
They say, "Why your chained? It look like a choker?"
That's for the slaves that had to wear the noose
Uh, no you can't cuff me, baby, let me loose
The way that I live, baby, that's a roof
Matching closet, it came with a pool
Bro moving 8 balls, not no pool
If you ask me his name then I don't have a clue (whoa)
Make 'em hit the folks every time that I shoot
Too much money, I'm evil from the root
Yeah, my shows they bust right through the roof
Saw your crowd at your concert on snooze
I'm a dog, bitch, I howl at the moon
I remember when I didn't have cable
That was back when I used to watch Zoom
Ooh, you better move

Banana clip, straight from the zoo
I live my life like a cartoon
Reality is not my move
I don't know why that girl so rude
Oh, that's 'cause her jeans they from Rhude
You better have you a real good excuse
He want the smoke but I don't got a Juul
I'm like, Mother Goose, if I say shoot
They're gonna shoot
Yu-Gi-Oh, Yu-Gi-Oh, you wanna duel?
Blue-Eyes White Dragon, no I will not lose

And I fuck with Nicki 'cause she not too picky
And she not too choosy but sometimes she bougie
I play with her kitty, until it get sticky
I'm movin' the bitch, just like an alien
Chop with a fifty, my Uzi Israeli
See, I turned to the boss, can't deal with no middleman
Anthony Davis, don't deal with the Pelicans
Straight out the mud, we got that work that turn you to the Grudge
Leave you slow like a snail, you get hit with these slugs
I say how I feel and I do what I want
And not just because it is what it was
I'm high like a bird, man, but don't got on Lugz
Know you heard what I said, got this shit out the mud
I'm not in these streets, I'm just close with plug
I just saw his mother, I gave her a hug
If you talkin' 'bout the work, nigga, just hide that, supply that
Stuff a hundred rounds in the compact, contact
I probably fucked the bitch from your home town projects
Opened up her mouth, put my dick up inside that
She don't get high, but she geeked off the contact
That's why I'll never ever ever keep in contact
Just closed the case, so a nigga can't find that
Baby, where your mind at?
Come here girl, sign that
Matter fact, uh, never mind then
Front door, find that after the climax
And she screamin' my name every time we behind it
When I heard the door, get up, baby, where my nine at?
Water on my neck, 3D like it's IMAX (water)
Diamonds turned a bird to a goddamn blind bat
Ass so fat that I gotta hit beside that
Heard a nigga put his Lamb' trucks on finance
