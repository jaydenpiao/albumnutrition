lyrics = '''
And you're sitting at home doing this shit?
You should be earning a medal for this
Stop fucking around and be a man
There ain't nothing out here for you
Oh yes there is, this!
Yo Nas
Yo what the fuck is this bullshit on the radio Son?
Chill chill, that's the shit God, chill
Hey yo yo, pull down the shade, man. Let's count this money, nigga
Hey yo Nas, put the Jackson's and the Grants over there
You know what I'm sayin? Cause we spending the Jackson's
You know how we get down baby
True, true
Nas, yo Nas, man shit is mad real right now in the Projects
For a nigga yo, word to mother. All them crab ass rappers
Be coming up to me man word to mother man I think we need
To let them niggas know it's real man
True indeed, know what I'm saying, but when it's real you doing this
Even without a record contract, know what I'm saying?
No question
Been doing this since back then
I'm saying regardless how it go down we gon keep it real
We trying to see many mansions and, and Coupes kid!
True, true
Hey yo where's Grand Wizard and Mayo at man?
Taking niggas a long time, man
Who got the Phillies? Take this Hennessey
Aiyyo Dunn! C'mon, C'mon, man stop waving that man
Stop pointing that at me Dunn, take the clip out
Nigga alright but take this Hennessey man

You know what time it is
I'm saying man, ya know what I'm saying?
Niggas don't listen man, representing
It's Illmatic
Yeah, yeah
Ayo, Black, it's time
Word, word, it's time, man
It's time, man
Aight, man, begin
Yeah, straight out the fuckin' dungeons of rap
Where fake niggas don't make it back
I don't know how to start this shit, yo, now
Rappers I monkey flip 'em with the funky rhythm I be kickin'
Musician, inflictin' composition, of pain
I'm like Scarface sniffin' cocaine
Holdin' a M16, see with the pen I'm extreme
Now, bullet holes left in my peepholes
I'm suited up in street clothes
Hand me a nine and I'll defeat foes
Y'all know my steelo with or without the airplay
I keep some E&J, sittin' bent up in the stairway
Or either on the corner bettin' Grants with the cee-lo champs
Laughin' at base-heads, tryna sell some broken amps
G-packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit
Reminiscin' about the last time the task force flipped
Niggas be runnin' through the block shootin'
Time to start the revolution, catch a body head for Houston
Once they caught us off guard, the MAC-10 was in the grass, and
I ran like a cheetah, with thoughts of an assassin
Picked the MAC up, told brothers, "Back up, " the MAC spit
Lead was hittin' niggas, one ran, I made him back flip
Heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look
Gave another squeeze, heard it click, "Yo, my shit is stuck"
Try to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now I'm in danger
Finally pulled it back, and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber
So, now I'm jettin' to the buildin' lobby
And it was full with children, probably couldn't see as high as I be
(So what you sayin'?) It's like the game ain't the same
Got younger niggas pullin' the triggers bringin' fame to they name
And claim some corners, crews without guns are goners
In broad daylight, stickup kids, they run up on us
.45's and gauges, MAC's in fact
Same niggas'll catch a back to back, snatchin' your cracks in black
There was a snitch on the block gettin' niggas knocked
So hold your stash 'til the coke price drop
I know this crackhead, who said she gotta smoke nice rock
And if it's good, she'll bring ya customers and measuring pots, but yo
You gotta slide on a vacation
Inside information keeps large niggas erasin' and they wives basin'
It drops deep as it does in my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
I think of crime, when I'm in a New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
Be havin' dreams that I'm a gangsta, drinkin' MoÃ«ts, holdin' TEC's
Makin' sure the cash came correct, then I stepped
Investments in stocks, sewin' up the blocks to sell rocks
Winnin' gunfights with mega cops
But just a nigga, walkin' with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
Give me a Smith & Wesson, I'll have niggas undressin'
Thinkin' of cash flow, Buddha and shelter
Whenever frustrated, I'ma hijack Delta
In the PJ's, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays
Young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze
Full of black rats trapped, plus the Island is packed
From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back, black
I'm livin' where the nights is jet black
The fiends fight to get crack, I just max, I dream I can sit back
And lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn
Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes
I got so many rhymes I don't think I'm too sane
Life is parallel to Hell but I must maintain
And be prosperous, though we live dangerous
Cops could just arrest me, blamin' us, we're held like hostages
It's only right that I was born to use mics
And the stuff that I write, is even tougher than dykes
I'm takin' rappers to a new plateau, through rap slow
My rhymin' is a vitamin, Hell without a capsule
The smooth criminal on beat breaks
Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
The city never sleeps, full of villians and creeps
That's where I learned to do my hustle had to scuffle with freaks
I'ma addict for sneakers, twenties of Buddha and bitches with beepers
In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya
Inhale deep like the words of my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I lay puzzled as I backtrack to earlier times
Nothing's equivalent, to the New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
Nasty Nas

20, it's a blessing
Essence of adolescence leaves my body, fresh and
physical frame celebrated 'cause I made it
One quarter through life some Godly-like thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I puffs from
My skull 'cause it's pain in my brain, vein, money maintain
Don't go against the grain, simple and plain
When I was young, I used to do my thing hard
Robbing foreigners, take their wallets, they jewelery
Rip their green cards
Dipped to the projects flashing my quick cash
Got my first piece of ass smoking blunts with hash
Now it's all about cash in abundance
Niggas I used to run with is rich or doing years in the hundreds
I switched my motto, instead of saying "fuck tomorrow"
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
At times I look back, loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
Time is Illmatic, keep static like wool fabric
Pack a 4-matic that crack your whole cabbage
Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we puff la
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die
Why we get high
Never know, that's real shit right
Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we puff la
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die
Whose world is this?
(The world is yours, the world is yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
It's yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
(The world is yours, the world is yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
I sip the Dom P, watching "Gandhi" 'til I'm charged
Then writing in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin
To hold the mic I'm throbbin', mechanical movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
The thief's theme: play me at night, they won't act right
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation, react like I'm facin' time like
"Pappy" Mason, with pens I'm embracin'
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
Suede Timb's on my feets makes my cipher complete
Whether crusing in a Sikh's cab, or Montero Jeep
I can't call it, the beats make me falling asleep
I keep falling, but never falling six feet deep
I'm out for presidents to represent me (say what?)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (say what?)
I'm out for dead presidents to represent me
Whose world is this?
(The world is yours, the world is yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
It's yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
(The world is yours, the world is yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
To my man Ill Will, God bless your life (it's yours!)
To my peoples throughout Queens, God bless your life
I trip, we box up crazy bitches
Aiming guns at all my baby pictures
Beef with housing police, release scriptures that's maybe Hitler's
Yet I'm the mild, money-getting style, rolling foul
The versatile, honey-sticking wild golden child
Dwelling in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled
Or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
There's no days, for broke days we sell it: smoke pays
While all the old folks pray to Jesus, soaking their sins in trays
Of holy water. Odds against Nas are slaughter
Thinking a word best describing my life to name my daughter
My strength, my son, the star, will be my resurrection
Born in correction. All the wrong shit I did, he'll lead a right direction
"How you living?" Large, a broker charge - cards are mediocre
You flipping coke or playing spit spades and strip poker?
Whose world is this?
(The world is yours, the world is yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
It's yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
(The world is yours, the world is yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single-handed
For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1, 000 miles from home
I need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Trying to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturing my peeps, now the income make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana, stabbing women like the Phantom
The crew is lamping, Big Willie-style
Check the chip-toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash through the flock wools, burning dollars to light my stove
Walk the blocks with a bop, checking dames, plus the games
People play, bust the problems of the world today
Nasty Nas in your area, about to cause mass hysteria
Before a blunt, I take out my fronts
Then I start to front, matter of fact, I be on a manhunt
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
That's like Malcolm X catching the Jungle Fever
King poetic, too much flavor, I'm major
Atlanta and braver, I pull a number like a pager
And I'm am ace when I face the bass
40 side is the place that is giving me grace
Now wait, another dose and you might be dead
And I'm a Nike head, I wear chains that excite the feds
And ain't' a damn thing gonna change
I'm a perform a strange show the mic wonder was born the game?
Nas, why did you do it
You know you got the mad fat fluid when you rhyme, it's halftime
halftime
I said it's like that, you know it's like that
I got at him, now you never get the mic back
When I attack, there ain't an army that could strike back
So I react never calmly on a hype track
I set it off wit my own rhyme
'Cause I'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time
I'm max like, I flex like sex
In your stereo sets, Nas will catch wreck
I used to hustle, now all I do is relax and strive
When I was young, I was a fan of the Jackson 5
I rock jewels, wear jewels to never run it
With more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach
Nasty Nas has to rise, kid, surprise
This is exercise til the microphone dies
Back in '83, I was an MC sparking
But I was too scared to grab the mic's in the parks and
Kick my little raps 'cause I thought niggas wouldn't understand
And now in every jam I'm the fucking man
I rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships
I used to watch C.H.I.P.S, now I load glock clips
I got to have it, I miss Mr. Magic
Rest in peace Mr. Magic
Tragic, check I'm an intellectual
And that's no question, yo
These are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand
'Cause in the streets, I'm well known like the number man
In my place wit the bass and all that
Explore rap and tell me Nas ain't all that
And next time I rhyme, I be fouled whenever I freestyle
I see trial niggas say I'm wild
I hate a rhyme biter's rhyme
Stay tuned, Nas, soon the real rap comes at halftime
Check, check, it's halftime
Lookin' at my roley it's about that time
I got it going on, even flip 'em on this song
Every afternoon, I kick half the tune
And in the darkness, I'm heartless like when the narcs hit
Word to Marcus Garvey or heartless Sparkton
'Cause when I blast the herb, that's my word
I be slaying them fast, doing this, that in the third
But chill, past the entree and let's lay
I bag bitches up at John Jay and hit a matinee
Putting hits on 5-0
Cause when it's my time to go, I wait for God wit the fo-fo
And biters can't come near
So go to hell to the foul cop who shot Garcia
I won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth I can't feed
That's extra Phillie change, more cash for that weed
This goes out to Manhattan, the island of Staten
Brooklyn, Queens is living fat and
The Boogie Down, enough props, enough clout
I'll will, rest in peace we was out
Halftime, lookin' at my roley it's about that time, it's halftime
I rap for listeners, prisoners
Henessey holders and old school niggas, then I be dissin' a
Unofficial that smoke woolie thai
I dropped out of Kooley High, gassed up by a coke head cutie pie
Jungle survivor, fuck who's the liver
My man put the battery in my back, a difference from Energizer
Sentence begins indented, with formality
My duration's infinite, money wise or physiology
Poetry, that's a part of me, retardedly bop
I drop the ancient manifested hip-hop, straight off the block
I reminisce on park jams, my man was shot for his sheep coat
I could see him drop in my weed smoke
It's real, grew up in trife times, murderous nights white lines
Hype vice, yeah
Chill on the block with Cognac gold strap
With my peeps that's into drug money, market into rap
No sign of the beast in the blue Chrysler, I guess that means peace
For niggas no sheisty vice to just snipe ya
Start off the dice-rollin' mats for craps to Ceelo
So roll a deuce nothin' below
Peace God, now the shit is explained
I'm takin' all you on a trip straight through memory lane
Damn it's like that y'all, it's like that y'all
"Now let me take a trip down memory lane"
"Comin' outta Queensbridge"
"Now let us take a trip down memory lane"
"Comin' outta Queensbridge"
"Now let us take a trip down memory lane"
"Comin' outta Queensbridge"
"Now let us take a trip down memory lane"
"Comin' outta Queensbridge"
One for the money
Two for pussy and foreign cars
Three for Alize niggas deceased or behind bars
I rap divine Gods check the prognosis, is it real, or showbiz?
My window faces shootouts, drug overdoses
Live amongst no roses, only the drama, for real
A nickel-plate is my fate, my medicine is the ganja
Here's my basis, my razor embraces, many faces
Your telephone blowin', black stitches or fat shoelaces
Peoples are petrol, dramatic automatic fo'-fo' I let blow
And back down po-po when I'm vexed so
My pen taps the paper then my brain's blank
I see dark streets, hustlin' brothers who keep the same rank
Pumpin' for somethin', some up-rise, plus some fail
Judges hangin' niggas, uncorrect bails, for direct sales
My intellect prevails from a hangin' cross with nails
I reinforce the frail, with lyrics that's real
Word to Christ, a disciple of streets, trifle on beats
I decipher prophecies through a mic and say peace
I hung around the older crews while they sling smack to dingbats
They spoke of Fat Cat, that nigga's name made bell rings, back
Some fiends scream, about Supreme Team, a Jamaica Queens thing
Uptown was Alpo, son, heard he was kingpin, yo
Fuck 'rap is real', watch the herbs stand still
Never talkin' to snakes 'cause the words of man kill
True in the game, as long as blood is blue in my veins
I pour my Heineken brew to my deceased crew on memory lane
It's like that y'all, memory lane
It's nothin' like the memories boy, let me take a trip down
Memory Lane
"Comin' outta Queensbridge"
Let me take a trip down memory lane"
"Comin' outta Queensbridge"
Remember lookin' out my window pane
"Comin' outta Queensbridge"
"Now let us take a trip down memory lane"
"Comin' outta Queensbridge"
Let me take a trip down memory lane
Comin' out of Queensbridge
What up, kid? I know shit is rough doin' your bid
When the cops came you shoulda slid to my crib
Fuck it, black, no time for lookin' back, it's done
Plus, congratulations, you know you got a son
I heard he looks like ya, why don't your lady write ya?
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
Flippin', talkin' about he acts too rough
He didn't listen, he be riffin' while I'm tellin' him stuff
I was like, "Yeah," shorty don't care, she a snake too
Fuckin' with them niggas from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach
It's buggedâplus little Rob is sellin' drugs on the dime
Hangin' out with young thugs that all carry 9's
And night time is more trife than ever
What up with Cormega? Did you see him? Are y'all together?
If so, then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Say what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commissary
You was my nigga when push came to shove
(One what?) One love!
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
Out in New York the same shit is goin' on
The crackheads stalkin', loudmouths is talkin'
Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walkin'
That nigga you shot last year tried to appear
Like he hurtin' somethin'
Word to mother, I heard him frontin'
And he be pumpin' on your block
Your man gave him your Glock
And now they run together â what up, son? Whatever
Since I'm on the streets I'ma put it to a cease
But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
Wildin' on the Island, but now in Elmira
Better chill, âcause them niggas will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
But maintain, when you come home the corner's ours
On the reals, all these crab niggas know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, see you on the next V-I
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks
Your brother's buckwildin' in 4-Main, he wrote me
He might beat his case, 'til he come home I'll play it lowkey
So stay civilized, time flies
Though incarcerated your mind dies
I hate it when your moms cries
It kinda makes me want to murder, for reala
I even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs, but one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack
Mind's in another world, thinkin'
"How can we exist through the facts?"
Written in school text books, bibles, et cetera
Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er
So I be ghost from my projects
I take my pen and pad for the weekend
Hittin' L's while I'm sleepin'
A two-day stay, you may say I need the time alone
To relax my dome, no phone, left the 9 at home
You see the streets had me stressed somethin' terrible
Fuckin' with the corners have a nigga up in Bellevue
Or HDM, hit with numbers from eight to 10
A future in a maximum state pen is grim
So I comes back home, nobody's out but Shorty Doo-Wop
Rollin' two phillies together: in the Bridge we call 'em oo-wops
He said: "Nas, niggas caught me bustin' off the roof
So I wear a bulletproof and pack a black tre-deuce."
He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep
Started coughin', one eye peeked to watch me speak
I sat back like The Mack, my army suit was black
We was chillin' on these benches
Where he pumped his loose cracks
I took the L when he passed it, this little bastard
Keeps me blasted and starts talkin' mad shit
I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him
âCause when the pistol blows
The one that's murdered be the cool one
Tough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up
Coulda caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen, so take heed, never bust up
At the crowd, catch him solo, make the right man bleed
Shorty's laugh was cold-blooded as he spoke so foul
Only 12, tryin' to tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose, wipin' the blunt's ash from my clothes
Then froze, only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
And told my little man I'ma ghost, I broze
Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from Nas: try to rise up above
Keep an eye out for Jake, Shorty Wop, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
To all my niggas locked up
From Queensbridge and all over
To my man [Goon?], one love
To my man Herb, one love
To my man [Lake Gucciano?], one love
Can't forget my motherfuckin' heart, Big [Bo?], one love
To [Oogie?], yeah, one love
Yeah, it's illmatic, (yeah)
It's illmatic, (yeah!)
It's illmatic
Let's go back a little bit
Yeah, whatever
(One time for your mind, one time)
Ayo, whatever
(One time for your mind, one time)
(Hey yo, Nas, kick that rhyme)
Check check it out
When I'm chilling, I grab the Buddha, get my crew to buy beers
And watch a flick, illin' and root for the villain, huh
Plus, every morning, I go out and love it, sort of chilly
Then I send a shorty from my block to the store for phillies
After being blessed by the herb's essence
I'm back to my rest, ten minutes, some odd seconds
That's where I got the honey at, spends the night for sexing
Cheap lubrication, Magnum protection
Picking up my stereo's remote control, quickly
Ron G's in the cassette deck, rockin' the shit, G
I try to stay mellow, rock, well, acapella rhymes'll
Make me richer than a slipper made Cinderella, fella
Go get your crew, Hobbes, I'm prepared to bomb troops
Rest in peace to my mom dukes
When I was ten, I was a hip-hoppin' shorty wop
Known for rocking microphones and twisting off a forty top, yeah
Yeah, whatever
(One time for your mind, one time)
Yeah whatever
One time for your mind one time
You know the hard times, kid
Shit, cold be starvin', make you want to do crimes, kid
But I'm a lamp, 'cause a crime couldn't beat a rhyme
Muslims yellin', free the mind
And I'm from Queensbridge, been to many places
As a kid, when I would say that out of town, people chased us
But now I know the time, got a older mind
Plus control a nine, fine, see, now I represent mine
I'm new on the rap game, niggas never heard of me
Yet I'm a meance, why police want to murder me
Heine dark drinker, represent the thinker
My pen rides the paper, it even has blinkers
Think I'll dim the lights then inhale, it stimulates
Floating like I'm on the north ninety-five interstate
Never plan to stop, when I write my hand is hot
And I jam a lot from the wiz' to Camelot
The parlayer, I'll make ya heads bop, par
I shine a light on perpetrators, like a cop's car
From day to night, I play the mic, and you'll thank God
I wreck shit so much, the microphone need a paint job
See my brain is incarcerated
Live at any jam, I couldn't count all the parks I raided
I hold a Mac-11, and attack the Reverand
I contact eleven L's, and max in heaven
One time for your mind, one time (Yeah whatever)
From ninety-two to ninety-nine
One time for your mind, one time (Yeah whatever)
Any day could be your last in the jungle
Get murdered on the humble, guns'll blast, niggas tumble
The corners is the hot spot, full of, criminals
Who don't care, guzzling beers, we all stare at the out-of-towners
They better break north before we get the four pounders
And take their face off the streets is real
Undercovers, homicide chasing brothers
The D.A.'s on the roof, trying to, watch us and lock us
Killer coppers, comin' through in helicopters
I drink a little vodka, spark a L and hold a Glock for
The fronters, wannabe ill niggas and spot runners
Thinking it can't happen til I, trap 'em and clap 'em
And leave 'em done, won't even run about
I don't believe in none of that shit, your facts are backwards
Nas is a rebel from the street corner
Pulling a Tec out the dresser, police got me under pressure
Represent, represent!
Represent, represent!
Represent, represent!
Represent, represent!
Yeah, they call me Nas, I'm not your legal type of fella
Moet drinking, marijuana smoking street dweller
Who's always on the corner, rolling up blessed
When I dress, it's never nothing less than Guess
Cold be walking with a bop and my hat turned back
Love committing sins and my friends sell crack
This nigga raps with a razor, keep it under my tongue
The school drop-out, never liked the shit from day one
Life ain't shit but stress fake niggas, crab stunts
I guzzle my Hennesey, pulling on mad blunts
The brutalizer, buddha sizer, accelerator
The type of brother who be pissing in your elevator
Ayo the rap game reminds me of the crack game
Used to sport Bally's and Gazelle's with black frames
Now I'm into fat chains, sex and Tecs
Fly new whips, new chicks, Heine's and Beck's, I represent
Represent, represent!
Represent, represent!
I represent y'all
See my, stacks are fat, this is what it's about
Before the BDP conflict with MC Shan
Around the time when Shante dissed the Real Roxxane
I used to chill up on the corner, hold the blunt
Every day's a different, had us running from cops
If it wasn't hanging out in front of cocaine spots
We was at the candy factory, breaking the locks
Nowadays, I need the cash in hand, like the next man
Fuck a yard God, let me see a hundred grand
Could use a gun Son, but fuck being the wanted man
But if I hit rock bottom I'ma be the Son of Sam
Then call the crew to get live too
With Swoop, Hakim, my brother Jungle, Big Bo, cooks up the blow
Mike'll chop it, Mayo, you count the profit
The shit is on the streets, this way the jakes'll never stop it
It's your brain on drugs, to all fly ladies and thugs
'Nuff respect to the projects, we ghost, One Love
Represent ya'll, represent!
Represent ya'll, represent!
Represent ya'll, represent!
Represent ya'll, represent!
The mic check is life or death, breathing a sniper's breath
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
Deep like The Shinin', sparkle like a diamond
Sneak a uzi on the island in my army jacket lining
Hit the Earth like a comet, invasion
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian, half-man, half-amazing
And my physical, I'll express through song
Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong
I drank Moet with Medusa, give her shotguns in hell
From the spliff that I lift and inhale, it ain't hard to tell
The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
Nas, stories by Aesop, place your loot up
Nas, I analyze
Inhale from the L, school a fool well, you feel it like braille
It ain't hard to tell, I kick the skill like Shaquille holds a pill
Vocabulary spills I'm ill
Plus 'Matic, I freak beats slam it like Iron Shiek
Jam like a tech with correct techniques
They analyze me, surprise me, but can't magnetize me
Scanning while you're planning ways to sabotage me
I leave 'em froze like heroin in your nose
Nas'll rock well, it ain't hard to tell
This rhythmatic explosion, is what your frame of mind has chosen
I'll leave your brain stimulated, niggas is frozen
Speak with criminal slang, begin like a violin
End like Leviathan, it's deep well let me try again
Wisdom be leaking out my grapefruit troop
I dominate break loops, giving mics men-e-straul cycles
Street's disciple, I rock beats that's mega trifle
And groovy but smoother than moves by Villanova
Yet still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stallone in Cobra
Packing like a rasta in the weed spot
Vocals'll squeeze glocks, MC's eavesdrop
Though they need not to sneak
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas's raps should be locked in a cell
It ain't hard to tell, 20 years
