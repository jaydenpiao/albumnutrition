Welcome to the No Pressure program
Good evening, this is Logic
And very happy I am to be back in the United States and back on the network
Even for so short a visit as this one
Back with old friends like No I.D. who is tonight's director and
Nobody argued the point, a lot of people asked us to do it again, so it's gratifying to get the chance to do it again
So it's gratifying to get the chance now (No I.D.)
Personally, I've never met anybody who didn't like The Incredible True Story
Now tonight, what we do have is a thriller
If it's half as good as we think it is, you can call it a classic
Quite possibly, a little escapade of mine involving a couple of planets which shall be nameless
Is responsible
Doesn't really matter
A story doesn't have to appeal to the heart, it can also appeal to the spine
And with two magic words
Ayy, no pressure
Never graduated, but I school 'em like professor
Growing up, the world always told me I was lesser
Growing up, the world told me I could not address her
Gangsters put that heat to your head like a hairdresser
If you press a issue on they block
(Hey, Logic, Snake here
I hear you're planning world domination through a new form of Metal Gear
Well, listen to me, it won't work)
This liquor that I'm drinking got me thinking 'bout some other shit
Feeling like I'm sinking like Titanic or some other ship
Word to your mothership, boy, this that gutter shit
Breaking down the weed to get high as Thomas and Kai
But y'all ain't ready for that shit, that's more like Ultra 85
Memories of powdered milk and roaches in my cereal
Praying that my crew next like cotton material
Never had a car, that's why I hate the fuckin' bus
Took the 61 to Germantown and hear them guns bust
Call it static, my headphones on, it's Illmatic
On my Rosa Parks, in the back writin' like B-Rabbit
How I carry it, murder the beat and then I'ma bury it
Producin' tracks for the underground like Harriet
Drop another number one and watch 'em all get mad again
Memorizing verses like the Vatican, I'm glad again
Empty the clip and then do that again
And now we ridin' 'round the city on a dollar twenty-five
Boy, you better keep your head down if you wanna stay alive
People telling you to stay in your lane, can't even drive
Tell you not to chase your dreams 'cause they chained to a nine-to-five
Bitch, I'm too alive like twins in the womb, come hither, consume
All of my memories from past and present like two identities
Logic fallin' off is an obscenity
Top five I better be, steadily
Doggin' these bitches like I'm a Pedigree
Obtain class with no degree
Fuck a GED, EBT, and the HOC
Feeling free, yeah, I'm feeling free
But it cost a fee to be the boss it cost to be
Over possessions like an apostrophe
It's chemical warfare on the block, who got the rock?
A tablespoon of baking soda leave you shellshocked
Leave the pusher in a cell block and his customer in a box
The government got my pops
The government can't be stopped
I'm a gladiator, this shit right here more like random thought
It's more like
We interrupt this transmission with a special report
Okay
Okay
Okay
Okay
Okay
I think it's gonna be a good day
Homie got the nine in the glove and he don't play
Had a lot of hard times, but it's okay
101 on the 405, OJ (Okay)
I think it's gonna be a good day
Homie got the nine in the glove and he don't play
Had a lot of hard times, but it's okay
101 on the 405, OJ (Okay)
I'm feelin' normal, yeah, I'm feelin' myself
Feelin' good, yeah, I'm feelin' my health
Got a couple plaques up on my shelf
Money in the safe at the crib just to feel my wealth
Think I'm gonna put it all on the line
I think I'm really gonna do it this time
I think I got a whole lot on my mind
Somebody tell God right now He need to hit my line (Yeah, uh)
Now I ain't sayin' this my "Jesus Walks"
I'm just sayin', God, I need to talk
Too many kids in the community outlined in chalk
Scared of drive-bys when they should just be scared of the dark
Who's really doin' they part?
They say they don't want messages in rap, it ruins the art
Well, here I am, people, yeah, now tear me apart
So much happenin' in the world, I can't touch on every topic
I know You hear it in my voice, make the devil stop it
Too many people dyin' and baby mamas cryin'
It's been a long time, God, can You hit my line?
Evil politicians, people on Twitter bitchin'
Hashtaggin', but in real life, they never pitch in
I came with conviction, I hope You came to listen
No matter how much I ignore it, this message my mission
God, hit my line, this world is in critical condition
Like a fiend that need fixin', that done battled addiction
Been addicted to money, been addicted to fame
Addicted to arenas and people screamin' my name
But it's time to let go, it's time to make a change
So can You hit my line? I know You hear this rhyme
But come to think of it, You probably hear this all the time
Probably hear this all the time
I think it's gonna be a good day
Homie got the nine in the glove and he don't play
Had a lot of hard times, but it's okay
101 on the 405, OJ (Okay)
I think it's gonna be a good day
Homie got the nine in the glove and he don't play
Had a lot of hard times, but it's okay
101 on the 405, OJ (Okay)
I'm feelin' normal, yeah, I'm feelin' myself
Feelin' good, yeah, I'm feelin' my health
Got a couple plaques up on my shelf
Money in the safe at the crib just to feel my wealth
Think I'm gonna put it all on the line
I think I'm really gonna do it this time
I think I got a whole lot on my mind
Somebody tell God right now He need to hit my line
This album was written over the course of one week
And mainly created in just four studio sessions between Logic and No. I.D.
But perfected over the course of the year that followed
Watch
Watch
Y'all niggas overdoin' it
You gotta slow that shit down
Take your time, reevaluate your shit, it don't matter (Watch)
Niggas ain't got money, ain't got time
Fuck it, just say this shit
You and me
Gon' live together in this perfect harmony (I hear 'em callin')
I can hear 'em callin' me
We've come a long way since H.O.C. (Watch)
You and me
Gon' live together in this perfect harmony (I hear 'em callin')
I can hear 'em callin' me
We've come a long way since H.O.C. (Watch)
I live by the beat, I die by the beat, since 1990, I (I)
Live by the beat, I die by the beat, like MPC Akai
Who I name William after 'cause I get bills from these beats
Fuck the industry, you know we keepin' it real up in these streets
Came up in a world that's off its axis
All that's promised, death and taxes
Don't give a fuck who be rhyming the fastest, my anxiety
Make me spit it a mile a minute
I'm stuck in a clinic like Flynn Montgomery
Take a step back, tell me right now, boy, just what your summary
Creeping through fireside
Smash the window of that fire ride
Just to see what we can snatch from up inside
'Til the flashin' lights come 'round that corner then we run and hide
Prayin' to God up in Heaven, eleven at night and I got no alibi
My damn, dip to Stewart Town
Best not come 'round these parts if you new in town
Wonder what my homies from back in the day livin' at, are doin' now
Running with my sister Jeannie, schooling me like Mr. Feeny
This is the first time I heard a gunshot on the block
Growing pains (Three), this the type of shit don't never stop
Here come the cops
Shooting up the hood like Black Ops
'Cause trigger-happy police tend to trigger happy people
And some people who believe we not equal shoot up the steeple
My God, if you exist then why do you make life so hard?
If you exist the way you think is avant-garde
If you exist you got a funny way of showing it
What happens in the afterlife?
These people think they knowin' shit
And on that note, I keep it G
Like track four, "Kick in the Door" by Notorious B.I.G. 
Don't believe me, look that shit up, I promise you'll find the key
To that punchline, feelin' just fine
Let the abyss of my mind, my mind consume
Snap my fingers like Thanos and Bobby Boy bringin' the doom
'Cause I'm 6:30, killin' shit, hands down and dirty
That white boy can't rap, he talk good and act nerdy
I just texted Erykah Badu
To let her know what I'm gon' do
Sample "Dreamflower" by Tarika Blue
That's cool with you?
Yeah, that's fine, baby, all gravy
Long as you know you my baby
And I beat yo' daddy like if he ever cheat on me
I mean she don't own the sample but she might as well
'Cause her and Dilla paved the way for all I got, and, well
I'ma show my gratitude, no attitude, no auto-tune like T-Pain
Doin' Unplugged, I'm unplugged, like Trinity
Wonder how the people gonna remember me, goddamn
Switch up the plan
We all say it, we all claim it but it's no use
The greatest rapper alive is probably stacking produce
Introduce you to my train of thought
Snapping on a track like the illest conductor
With no contradiction
I brought my heart to the table
Fact and never fiction, fuck a fable
Ready and willing you better believe I'm able to spit
Power through these lines faster than fiber-optic cable, I'm gone
You and me
Gon' live together in this perfect harmony (I hear 'em callin')
I can hear 'em callin' me
We've come a long way since H.O.C. (Watch)
You and me
Gon' live together in this perfect harmony (I hear 'em callin')
I can hear 'em callin' me
We've come a long way since H.O.C. (Watch)
Watch
From the bottom
When you come from the bottom, you ain't get no chances, man
I'ma do this shit 'til the Fourth Of July, blow up straight to the sky (Watch)
Nigga fuck it, we high
I remember when a nigga had to ask for money
It's been a long time since I had to do that shit (Watch)
This shit ain't free
I got the roof over my head and a bed, nigga, my bitch givin' me head
I'd rather get money instead
Man, it's Bobby Boy Records in this bitch
Y'all niggas better write this shit down (It don't matter)
'Cause 10 years from now, we on top
And we ain't never gon' stop
All money in (Watch)
This album marks the reunion of Logic and No I.D. 
For the first time in six years
Since the inception of its predecessor
Ayy, it's a celebration, bitches
Came a long way from bus stops and washing dishes
From rags to bitches
Stovetop to Mastro's, man, this shit is delicious
People denying my past like that shit is fictitious
I'm Spike Spiegel, but I'm known to be vicious
I get under people's skin like stitches
No strings attached, I just let it dissolve
Give it time and then let it resolve
It's been a minute now, my style feeling infinite now
Used to people pulling me down, it ain't shit to me now
Don't let it get to me now
Threw out my phone, they can't get to me now
Keep it humble, but love to get big head
Bad bitches wanna fuck me, I get money instead
I mean what's rap without a little braggadocio?
Fuck people telling me to rap just how I'm supposed to
Most people wanna tell you what to do
'Cause it's what they wanna do if they had an opportunity to
But too scared
That's why they live vicariously through you
Logic, what you should do is rap like
Uh, uh, nah, I'd rather not
That's why I'm in a mansion and you sleeping on a cot
But you still study everything I drop
Too many people wanna tell you what you can and cannot
Go to school, get a job, get married and have kids
People gon' tell you what to do for long as you live
Break the cycle, and shoot for the stars, Moonwalk like Michael
To be a leader, first, you gotta be a disciple
(It's a celebration)
For the beat, the rhymes, the streets, the dimes (It's a celebration, y'all)
You wanna try to eat, motherfucker, this my time (It's a celebration)
For the beat, the rhymes, the streets, the dimes
You wanna try to eat, motherfucker, this my time
Ayy, it's a celebration, y'all, celebration now
Wherever I go in the nation, they celebrating my style
It's a celebration, y'all, celebration now (Yeah)
Wherever I go in the nation, they celebrate the style
Look
I can't front, we was hyped up for some nosebleeds
Now we sitting courtside, still posted in my white tee
I'm a Golden State Warrior when I'm spittin' this
Like KD from MD, that's Montrose, so venomous
You know it's me, Silas never jumpin' for your bitch ass
I'm hopping on a plane that's first class
'Member back in the day, we used to fast
Had no money in the bank account
My cousin showed me, pushing weight
Almost stabbed at the transit in the dead of the night
These fucking zombies, but really that's beyond me
Tryna live my dreams from everything that I seen as a young man
So if you see me rapping, know I got the upper hand
But on the other hand, you see a couple rubber bands
And now Logic really out here makin' dreams come true
Bobby Boy Records spittin' thorough
Every time I grab the mic, I'm paintin' murals
Doing shows in other countries, coming back with Euros
This that type of flow that really make your girl go
I'm marvelous, I'm all of this
That's why your girl all on my dick
I make 'em cum, boy, you make 'em sick
My net worth get the bank grossed out
No I.D. up on the beat, but 6ix, he kill it, no doubt
This a revelation, memories when I drive the M5 or the bus station
I have evolved, you's a motherfuckin' crustacean
What more can I say? Run it back and they hit replay
Bobby Boy Records, yeah, we celebratin' all day
(It's a celebration)
For the beat, the rhymes, the streets, the dimes (It's a celebration, y'all)
You wanna try to eat, motherfucker, this my time (It's a celebration)
For the beat, the rhymes, the streets, the dimes (It's a celebration)
You wanna try to eat, motherfucker, this my time (It's a celebration)
Ayy, it's a celebration, y'all, celebration now
Wherever I go in the nation, they celebrating my style
It's a celebration, y'all, celebration now
Wherever I go in the nation, they celebrate the style
Logic and his crew played chess mercilessly throughout the album's creation
Okay, settle, settle, settle, settle, ladies and gentlemen, settle down
Okay, so, this next brother we're gonna bring up to the stage usually does not come in on Monday nights
You're in for a real treat, ladies and gentlemen
Give it to Mr. Hall
Rip out my soul from the depths of my flesh
Flesh from my blood I caress
Right on the page so it's fresh
I take my time, but express
Lot on my mind, but I guess
It's just in my genes like a Glock 17, like a genetic scene
Kick in the door, we blow it off the hinge
Music my drug, tie it off, then inject the syringe
It's in my blood, ain't no need to pretend
Therapist tell me I don't need to defend
Therapy tell me I don't need to explain
Just drop the record on the needle and express my pain
Can't wait until my son shine and together we reign
My queen's by my side like Manhattan
Fuck rapping, this is poetic conviction
My rendition is not meant for your diction
Battled addiction in the womb
A crack baby by definition
Keys to ignition with no permission
That mean that I'm driven
Alive 'cause I'm living
Fuck workin' with what you've been given
I knew I always wanted more like The Roots in nine-five
And I'll be sure to do more for my family than mine did
'Cause hip-hop rhymes taught me more than my moms did
Didn't drink 'til I was twenty-five 'cause I'm my mom's kid
All I knew was alcoholism and prison
Only saw domestic violence and racial division
Social worker trying to take me away
But I know that group home probably worse, hell nah, no way
At least I know my odds here, I'ma be okay
Adapted to the lifestyle, so I'ma be okay
Keep that one just in case, yeah
I'm just an entity
My DNA not my identity
Finding serenity
Become a better man, I better be
For the child in my baby mama stummy, never crummy
We get big bread
Tryin' to be the greatest, that shit been dead
I'm trying to be the happiest that I can be instead
I'm trying to get ahead like a fetus
Money don't complete us, but it feed us, it can lead us to depression
Being rich is not a blessing, fame is not a blessing
Wasn't 'til I was rich and famous, I learned that lesson
What's the meaning of life, to live it, what I'm guessing
Live it, live it
Living life like this is so crazy
Hip-hop is amazing
One day, you're on top and the next, they want to erase 'em
Goddamn, what I'm facing
Every day a new frustration
People thinking I'm complacent
People thinking that I changed like a cashier
But I can't let that register, get the fuck up on out of here
Buy a brick and roll it, light it, get high as the stratosphere
I can hear the voices in my mind when I rhyme
Give it up, you're out of time
Never even had a prime
Like the Preemo never linked up with 5'9"
Bitch, I'm back like the muscles surrounding my vertebrae
Okay, fuck what you gotta say
I keep it going, already know when I'm flowing
For the listener, you're kind of like a therapist
Or rather Cole in 2005, flowing like Canibus
That throwback shit, yeah, that throwback shit
Fuck what you heard, my catalog, it ain't got no wack shit
'Cause I'm a gladiator in the Colosseum, everybody wanna be him
'Til they feel like they can't be him, then they wanna see him lose
Wrote this poem in navy, that's what I call singing the blues
Word to Dot D, my family got me, no carbon copy
Life can hit you harder than Drago
But if I roll with the punches when it's rocky, don't ever stop me
Never top me, never cocky, I'm never cocky
Okay, well, maybe sometimes
Occasionally in some rhymes
But it's fine, in due time
I'm the illest to ever do it, come now, Bobby Boy, cool it
An indigenous era of the indigenous emcee
Riding this motherfucker 'til the tank on E
What's up?
(You-you-you-you-you)
(You-you), yeah, uh
Yeah, uh, yeah (Yeah)
Uh, uh, yeah, yeah
(You-you-you-you-you-you-you)
Uh, yeah
Uh, yeah
(You-you-you-you-you-you-you)
Fuck all the bullshit, dig from deep down inside
I wrote this sitting shotgun in my favorite ride
Reflecting on memories from my childhood
Bringing a baby in this world, I hope my child good
All I ever gave a fuck about was my career
But all that shit out the window now that my son is here
Fuck sales and streams, none of that shit entails dreams
Fuck rap, fuck press, fuck feeling like I'm less
If it ain't 'bout my happiness, than I could give a fuck less
I remember window shopping
Now I'm shopping for windows for my baby new room
Bobby coming soon
And that's the type of line I would've second-guessed
Putting on my shit before
Out of fear that they would hate 'cause they couldn't relate
'Cause it wasn't relevant
Give a fuck if it's evident, this right here is the evidence
I'm like Leo in Revenant, bear with me
You could tear me apart
But that won't take away the fact I wrote this shit from the heart
Where it's built from the start
Where it's finna stay
I've learned every day's a good day
Surrounded by people that love me
Don't want nothing from me but my happiness
Off the internet, that's when I'm at my happiest
Scrolling so much, my thumb fucked up
We call that carpal tunnel vision
Follow me like religion on this course of collision
Feeling imprisoned, and this is my freedom through these lyrics
As I repeat them and beat 'em into my conscience like Adonis
All this lyricism straight to the dome like cocaine through the sinus
I think I finally found my paradise, that's word to Thomas
Goddamn, goddamn, conversations with people
Crazy how one day, the legends forget that they equal
On this Under Pressure sequel
We not taking it back, we keepin' it pushing
People scared of change
But you'll find me deep in the cushion
Even when I win, it feel like I'm losing
Listening to beats, in the Bimmer cruisin'
I think I got another hit, I could feel my body bruisin'
What's the conclusion of rappin'?
My hypothesis, I'm darker than Gotham is
Like reading Nostradamus at 90 degrees
You better believe
I know how to turn a profit with ease
Diacritical lifestyle, I'm always overseas
Hurricane Bobby in the studio blowing trees
What's the topic? I drop it
Fuck around then leave them all concussed
When I bust, no thrust, this world we livin' in is fucked
Industry rule number four thousand and eighty one
Your new shit ain't good as your old shit
'Til your new shit is your old shit, son
And then some, gotta get some
I wear this 24 karat solid gold Rollie for my son
As an heirloom, not for looking dope as I rhyme
As a representation to give your family your time
If you're searching for love in the industry you'll be let down
They don't love you 'til you dead and then they call you profound
No matter how mainstream you was in the end, you still underground
That's the truth, feeling close to the cliff, like Rick Dalton in the booth
Money ain't the key to happiness and this the proof
Modern day rap is like a golden era spoof
But a few of us were searching within the second renaissance
And I know that my debutantes
Been keeping the legacy going
By flowing so involuntarily seamless
Me and my team is finally reaping
What we been sowing like a seamstress
I said I'm on one, I know I'm unsung
Was livin' my life backward like Tariq on Undun
And now they wonder how I got over son (Do you want more?)
Hell yeah, now check the method
I been livin' outside of pages for ages
Now I'm back, Chocolate City, home of percussion, Maryland on my back
From Takoma Park, all the way to Southeast DC
It feel like forever ago, it feel like BC
Everlasting life, kickin' rhymes in the parking lot at night
Inhale, exhale, people hate
Oh well, 2012
Dreamin' I'm a freshman on XXL
2013, on the cover XXL
Livin' life behind these bars with no intention of postin' bail
'Cause I prevail
But that's a story for another time
Story for another rhyme
And on my darkest days, I know that the sun will shine, eventually
Greatest lyricist to ever do it, yeah essentially
And if we're being modest then potentially
And if we're being humble then...
Oh shit, it's Raquel, she's a fuckin thot
Ayy, fuck you guys, fuck you guys
Suck my dick
Straight on the basement mic
Ayy, man fuck all these punchlines and shit man
I just wanna tell a story, I just wanna have some fun
Back in the basement type shit
Ayo, once upon a time a couple of guys from out this world
Was talkin' rap and hip hop with a young synthetic girl
The year was 2115 at Babel Space Station
Was home to the very last of the human population
The captain name was Thomas, the infantry man was Kai
And he's the man that discovered the Ultra 85
Accompanied by a girl inside their ear, her name was Thalia
Made of ones and zeros, she was a program
You could ask her any question even about the fall of man
Then one day they discovered a planet in deep space
That nobody before them had ever found in they database
I mean, maybe it's the place that's meant for the human race
The planet Paradise, Kai said that time is my God
It be very nice, traveling through outer space
We done had some scary nights
We done had some scary fights
All about that rap shit, Kai like that trap shit
Thomas love that boom bap shit
I wish God was real, I wish I could just get raptured
What if this planet full of aliens and we get captured?
Don't think that way my son
Everything gon' be fine, we finna have some fun
And if by chance we do come across an alien
I'ma blow his ass away with this here molecular gun
Set to kill, never stun
Wagwan, we get it done
Now the ship is enterin' the atmosphere (Ten, nine)
We gon' take a look around and get the hell up outta here (Eight, seven)
We gon' double check that it's habitable and livable for man (Six, five)
And no matter what happens you know we gon' stick to the plan (Four, three)
Understood? Understand, all good? Let's get it then (Two, one)
Once they touched down nobody could hear a sound
'Til they opened up the ship door, that rappelled to the ground
What they found, a planet full of life
A planet full of shit they never seen
Straight up out a movie scene
On some Tarantino meets Christopher Nolan, nah mean?
Walk around the planet for hours, they was exhausted
If it wasn't for the music in they ears, they would have lost it
The seventh album by a musician they both revered
First time this planet heard it, let's call it a world premiere
Thomas thinkin' about a picture of his girl
That he left on the Aquarius Three in his dresser
Wishin' he could undress her
Give it up like no lesser
Kai thinkin' nuts like a professor
Wondering if the oxygen on this planet fresher
Now is it us or is the natural life on this world the aggressor?
All the negative shit inside of his head, he need a refresher
Two men here to save the world, no pressure
Bitch, I did it, I made it, I'm loved and I'm hated
I started from the bottom, now my neighborhood is gated
They say, "Drink to your accomplishments," so every night I'm faded
Feel like every other day, me and somebody new related
You're my sister, cousin, brother from the other side? (The other side)
Well, I don't know who told you that (My mama)
Well, she fucking lied
Ayy, wake up, wake up, get your cake up
Cut it up like it's cocaine, shake up
All the streets with all these beats
I body beats, I'm not discreet (Per-Per-Perfect)
This is how I feel on the inside
All you non-talent rappin' motherfuckers better run and hide
You worthless, you have no purpose, fuckin' imposter
You gots to get it through your head
You won't ever get no handout
Fuckin' with your ass, it'd be like throwing a band out (Per-Per-Perfect)
My flow increased, my dough increased
You know I leave them all deceased
I am a fucking beast, I'm from the East
I keep the peace, don't need a piece
But I keep a piece, got it, capisce?
That boy gon' eat, this is a feast
Once I release, I'm smokin' trees
I bought my shit, I don't need no lease
So fuck you up like Master P (Perfect)
This shit right here a masterpiece, I'm comin' in hot like the police
Shooting my shot like the police
All on the block like the policemen, who gon' (Stop, stop)
The police from leaving bodies in the motherfuckin' streets, man? (Fire, per-per-perfect)
Logic cites Nujabes, MF Doom, RZA, and Kanye West as key inspirations behind his production style
Knockin' doors down, showin' parts around
I'ma come through and show my wood pine
Knockin'— knockin' doors down, showin' parts around
I'ma— I'ma come through and show my wood pine, I'ma— I'ma come—
Knockin' doors— knockin'— knockin' doors down, down
Knockin' doors, knock— knock— knock— knock— knockin' doors down
I'ma—I'ma come through— I'ma— I'ma come— down
I'ma come through— I'ma— I'ma come— down (Yeah)
Paper chasin' on occasion
West Deer Park, that's my location
Life and death was what we was facin'
Boy, gotta get that motivation
Back in the basement
Look at my idols, I'm feelin' adjacent
Doin' the shit that I wish I was doing, I'm feelin' impatient
Throwin' parties and catching cases
That's the life, but that shit basic
I've cooked crack, I can't erase it
If I could, would not replace it
Grew up all alone
Had to teach myself to tie my laces
What's the deal?
I'ma play the field
Rattpack, we keep it real
Nothin' but love for the people that paved the way
So a brother like me, he can get it today
Antoine, Erykah and 3K
Can't forget those ain't here today
R.I.P. JD and Pimp C
Payin' respect, so don't hold it against me
Devil he callin' me, he love to tempt me
God exempt me, why you sent me here?
What I think about year to year
What I've been through these people only see through a peephole, yeah
Not a single one got an idea
So I write it down on this page
Feel like I'm 35 times my age
Look in the mirror don't know what to say
But I'm happy the man I is
Yeah, yeah
I said I'm happy the man I is
And I'm proud of the man I've become
I'm proud that I'm from a slum
And never got cold, I never got numb
Except for the wintertime and then some
I transcend and I transform
Poetic vision in rare form
Growing up, nobody there for him
I promise when I have a family I'ma be there for 'em
I love hip-hop
Hatin' motherfucker, go kick rocks
No matter what happen I never gon' stop
Like Cole said, if they don't know yo' dreams
Then they can't shoot 'em down
But I'ma let the world know
'Cause I'm too high up to hit the ground
This shit right here is like therapy, spit it verily
I ain't perfect, I got problems, I got issues like People magazine
Shoot from the hip and reload the magazine
I wish I could just go on forever, forever, ever and ever
But this rhyme
Ill as it is divine
Gon' be cut short today 'cause I'm out of studio time
Only thought I was recording these horns and not no rhyme
What can I say? Inspiration hits at any time
So I guess I'll have to conclude all my thoughts another time
Another rhyme
Another— Ano— i— wo— a— rhyme
Anime such as Cowboy Bebop
Trigun, and Samurai Champloo
Were in constant rotation
During the making of this album
Yeah, yeah
Hahaha
Ayy
Chillin' with the homies at the crib
Bumpin' Pac Div, this the life I live, you ain't know about it
Hit the studio with No I.D.​
Make a couple platinum records in that bitch and then I dip up out it
On the 101, my wife text me
Talkin' 'bout, "You gotta get home, feed your son," girl, don't trip about it
Walk up in with apple sauce and broccoli
Little Bobby, better eat your greens, boy, don't give me lip about it
I'm a dad, this my life
This the type of shit I write
I was hungry in the basement, now that boy, he full of life
Smoking dope high as a kite
Only when that babysitter at the crib, though
Take my shorty to Nobu and dig up in her rib though, ayy, yeah
(Take my shorty to Nobu and dig up in her rib though, yeah)
'Cause back in my day it was food stamps
And I love my wife like I am Chance
I bet you'd rap about the shit me and him rap about
If you had ever made it out, but you ain't never had the chance
Uh, uh, circumstance
Uh, uh, way of life
Uh, uh, my decisions
Uh, uh, made 'em right
Chillin' with the homies at the crib
Bumpin' Pac Div, this the life I live, you ain't know about it
Hit the studio with No I.D.​
Make a couple platinum records in that bitch and then I dip up out it
On the 101, my wife text me
Talkin' 'bout, "You gotta get home, feed your son," girl, don't trip about it
Walk up in with apple sauce and broccoli
Little Bobby, better eat your greens, boy, don't give me lip about it (Ayy, ayy)
I've upgraded while they waited, will they love it, will they hate it?
Who gives a fuck though?
Rappers praying they next, this shit is cutthroat
I'm livin' on another planet
My manic depression make me constantly wanna panic
I'm stressing on stage, pretendin' everybody undressing
I think I'll never learn my lesson, but fuck it all, it doesn't matter
Ayo, I'm on a lyrical, poetic rhetoric
Lyrical miracle, satirical shit
If you don't like my conscious rap, you won't like my material shit
Love him or hate him, everybody know Logic can spit
Used to be up to date on that rap political shit
But nowadays I'm up to my elbows
And every single inch of my body in my baby's shit
I could tell you more about diapers than modern rappers in cyphers
I used to be about the B-Rabbits and Mekhi Phifers
Hit the stage, grip the mic and murder you like a pro-lifer
But I'm done now, I got a son now
Fuck the rap game, I'm done now
Chillin' with the homies at the crib
Bumpin' Pac Div, this the life I live, you ain't know about it
Hit the studio with No I.D.​
Make a couple platinum records in that bitch and then I dip up out it
On the 101, my wife text me
Talkin' 'bout, "You gotta get home, feed your son," girl, don't trip about it
Walk up in with apple sauce and broccoli
Little Bobby, better eat your greens, boy, don't give me lip about it
They say that that boy done changed
He don't rap about his everyday life, he ain't the same
Goddamn, already had a hard life once
Am I supposed to recreate it every album for you cunts? Okay
You want to hear about my everyday
I wake up, I wake my son up, then I feed him
And lead him into his car seat
Drive up the street down to Target
Don't do hard drugs or beat my wife
But the paparazzi still wanna start shit
I don't answer their questions, I leave 'em in the dark, bitch
Then I walk through the automatic doors
A couple fans spot me but, shit, I ain't on tour
I ain't trying to ignore her
But I head to aisle four 'cause my drawers stank as fuck
And I need some new drawers
Then I spot some more fans, stan hella hardcore (Can I have a picture?)
Asking for a pic and I say sure
Scratch my dick and shake his hand
Shaking uncontrollably, he tells me I'm the man
Now I'm headed to aisle three for some Bounty paper towels
I also grab some wet wipes to clean the shit from my bowels
A really hot girl walks by with a fat ass
But I'm just wondering if Hefty really holds the most trash
Forgot my card at home, thank God I brought some cash
Then I grab some Preparation H for the critics up my ass
Head to aisle five for some Sgt. Smash cereal
Is this want you wanted, everyday life material?
I'm not a kid anymore and be sure shit's boring
Made it out the basement, now my bank account soaring
Most exciting part of my life is probably touring
Don't get me wrong, I love fans in every single city
But hotels suck and the internet is shitty
I mean, why rap about everyday shit
When I could murder punch lines and sound dope like this?
Chillin' with the homies at the crib
Bumpin' Pac Div, this the life I live, you ain't know about it
Hit the studio with No I.D.​
Make a couple platinum records in that bitch and then I dip up out it
On the 101, my wife text me
Talkin' 'bout, "You gotta get home, feed your son," girl, don't trip about it
Walk up in with apple sauce and broccoli
Little Bobby, better eat your greens, boy, don't give me lip about it
Hello, no one is available to take your call
Please leave a message after the tone
Bro, call me back
We couldn't get the fuckin' Super **** sample cleared again, so fuckin' annoying, bro
But honestly, I just say that we chop up the Toro y Moi joint
That we were gonna put on Ultra 85
And just like flip, fuckin' freak the shit outta that joint
I think it could be crazy
Call me back, I'ma chop it up on the MPC
Here I go
Five hooks, man
Ayo, this shit only got like five hooks on it, dawg
All lyricism, ho
I was like, "Yo, I'm pickin' up that pen, I'm goin' fuckin' crazy"
I don't give a shit, dawg
Yo, we finna, ayo, ayo, fuck Raquel though, fuck that bitch
It's what you all been waitin' for, ain't it?
This No Pressure shit kinda got us reacquainted
I'm happy you could join me in this universe I painted
Such a beautiful feeling, I really can't explain it
I hit the stage and like a thousand bitches fainted (Nigga, you ain't shit)
Damn, that boy, he back at it again
Droppin' bars when I pick up the pen, so let's begin
No I.D. my mentor, but it's time for the story's end, yeah
Ayy, I'm tryna do shit different now (Woo)
I love this BPM, but this a different style (Woo)
I never been this happy before, this a different smile
Hey, yeah, this that barbecue music
Life is a blessing and a curse depending how you use it
Some days I'm happy, some days I'm fucked up
Some days I tell the voice in my head to shut the fuck up
Yeah
Motivated by paper and pussy, always been a passion
Whippin' that Chevrolet Impala, my speakers blastin'
Hungry like I'm fastin', who the illest? Just ask 'em
Louis Vuitton rhyme, relevantly old-fashioned
Like we (Like we), like we always do it this time, homie
I go for my homie, I gots to shine, homie
All I do is grind, homie, all I do is rhyme
I provide for mine, homie, uh, uh, y'all know me (Yeah, yeah, y'all know me, yeah)
I started with just a dollar and a dream
Like Jermaine in '09, know what I mean?
Fresh on the scene like a first take
I dropped my first tape then felt the earth shake
But let's accelerate
Dropped the second tape, 2011, and now we elevate
Def Jam wanna sign me, it's time to celebrate
But little did I know, I had so much further to go
Let's take a trip down memory lane
Logic arrived and he fucked up the game, simple and plain
Never scared to do it different, no two albums sound the same
I got tracks with Wu Tang and 2 Chainz, Killer Mike and Gucci Mane
Rap shit, trap shit, you know I do it with no shame
Spit the illest yoke or flame, always go against the grain
I was fly before the fame, before I could afford a plane
Touch down like Notre Dame to get as high as my strain
2014 release day, I need morphine
Def Jam under shipped me, not a CD on the rack
RattPack had to ask 'em to unbox it in the back
What the fuck is that? Honestly, it sound like a fable
Fast forward, 2020, I'm the face of the label and I am
Who gives a fuck about the leak when you got the well?
Watch me excel, propel, then ghost the fuck out like Dave Chappelle
You the illest, pray tell, I'm like God before Lucifer fell, I raised hell
Had bars when I was broke 'cause I couldn't raise bail
But now my bars gold 'cause I'm Wall Street, broker
Money like I sell coca, livin' La Vida Loca shit
That ain't a line just to flex, just to let you know you next
If you put your mind to it, you can do it
Trust me 'cause I been through it, now get to it, ain't nothin' to it
Actually living your life is exponentially different from just being alive
Yeah
Depression, anxiety got ahold of me
'Cause people say they want the older me
Well, I'm thirty, this the oldest me
Behold it's me, the piece of shit that's not good enough
Not black enough, not hood enough
Not rich enough, not poor enough
My heart has poured enough
I been beaten and battered, my confidence shattered
Been broken and tattered
I'm constantly second guessin' if my profession is worth it on my mental state
Writin' this from a dark place with humility and grace
Peace, love, and positivity was my nativity
But not when socials are in my vicinity
I'm not runnin' from the internet
My god, I was at its birth, I've been a vet
Goin' berserk like Peter down in InterTech, yo, ayy
It's deeper than the surface, I'm searchin' for purpose
I'm tired of searchin' for Logic on Google on purpose just to read that I'm worthless
I remember makin' music alone, just a pen and a microphone
But nowadays it's hard to get in the zone
Writin' rhymes was easy before the fame
Now I'm constantly overthinkin' every line, it's a shame
Rap used to fill me with joy, now it's nothin' but pain
I'm stuck in the game, tryna get back from where I came
I write this letter for the person who's listenin'
Fed up and tired of people dismissin' 'em, I'm with you
I been through what you been through
No amount of money can take away the feelin' of insecurity
Only through maturity can we overcome
Feel like I've been overrun, feel like it's over, I'm done
Whoever told you success gon' make you happy? You been lied to
All of my dreams came true but I bleed and cry too
Never been perfect, I failed every time I tried to
Feelin' hated and underappreciated
Every time I look in the mirror, I wonder, "Why you?"
Shit, I'd love to end this on some positive shit
Hit you with punchlines instead of some derogative shit
But it's okay to be sad sometimes and tired of shit, I guess
And people say, "Well you're just out for money"
I say, "That's none of your business"
You see, a lot of people don't feel happy
Unless they have another thing beyond money, which is called status
And status, to a very large extent in our economy consists in
In having this thing and that thing and the other thing, and having a swimming pool
A, uh, Ferrari, uh, certain kind of clothes and uh, certain kind of house
And so on, and so on, and so on
And we think, uh, we need all that
Because we haven't asked ourselves whether that was what we really wanted
They all think they gotta have this, they gotta have that
And uh, they don't really want it
If they sat back and considered, "Do I need all that? Is this trip really necessary?"
They would come to the conclusion that it wasn't, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
You wanna learn your ABCs, little Bobby?
Yeah? You wanna learn your ABCs? Yeah?
Yeah, let's do it
Yeah, A, I been real that's all I ever knew how to be
Fuck what you heard, I only write what I see
Second I deploy, I destroy 'til the tank on E
The underdog, they wouldn't bank on me
F 'em all, I feel the beat in my heart like cholesterol, check the EKG
HNIC, ain't nobody flyer than me
Not a single one of you that I know conspire to be
I hit the J and get as high as can be
Okay, maybe not as high as can be
I'm a businessman, I got important people to see
Mainly No I.D. cooking up in studio D
That underground shit, L train across town shit
This that Nas, it's like Queensbridge, king, crown shit
Study my lyricism whenever you and your friends meet
I got enough M's in the bank to make ends meet
Oh my God, get gritty, '96 P Diddy, setting fire to the city
Keep it real, keep it true, sicker than the flu
You can smoke government dope and not get higher than my IQ
Are you ready? I'm calm my arms are steady
I'm armed and ready, digging in you like a machete
Surprise, confetti
You going to need more than bed rest when I hit you with these 26 bullets, no excess
I never went to school, never went to MIT, but my imagination out of this world like MIB
Who are you to me? These other rappers envy me, the MVP, born and raised in MD, get it B
Don't get it confused, fuck the style everyone use
Switch up the rhythm every track, flows, I never double use
X marks the spot, every day I give what I got
That's why I'm on top, steady running shit and you not
You steadily flop, every album steadily drop
Think you can do it 'cause I do it? Come now, boy, better stop
Trying to take me out? My advice is aim for the top
I know I make rapping look easy, but I promise it's not
Bob's Demo 2005
Take one, yo
I set my sh—
Nah, on the second thought I can't play this
Come on, play it, man
Play that shit, man
Come on, nigga, play that shit
Never one to flip scripts
I'm more raw then imaginary rubbers
Rain in the gutter, my talented knife cutter
Always flowing venomous, never rolling in regiments
Whipping read to intelligence, you copy then we settle in
Possibilities is endless, you'll never catch me pen-less
Suicidal lyrics, controversy like stem-cell research
Ain't no time to compromise, my rhymes immortalized
Visualize as I vocalize, worldly lies, that we're hypnotized
Staring into space like the Enterprise
Contemplating on words that shall arise
Mentality merciless, never sympathize
Yeah
Smoking weed in gazebos, incognito
Attracting more microphones than Magneto and that's real
Blunts keep rolling like bitches on E pills
I saw a kid with no smile on his face today
"Where is my place in this bright future?" I heard him say
Heard him s— I heard him s— I heard him say
Say I ain't good enough, they say I ain't hood enough
Even if I signed to Yeezy, I wouldn't be good enough (Good enough)
(Heard him s— I heard him s— I heard him say)
Killin' myself to make a killin'
Fuck the bullshit, I'ma just write what I'm feelin' (Write what I'm feelin')
(Heard him s— I heard him s— I heard him say)
I'd rather be hated for who I am than loved for who I'm not
Give a fuck if it's hot (Fuck if it's hot)
I saw a kid with no smile on his face today
"Where is my place in this bright future?" I heard him say
That boy different, don't fuck with him
But I'd rather stand out than stand in
Let the story begin (Turn the mic down)
(Heard him s— I heard him s— I heard him say)
Look in the mirror and what I tell 'em?
Reflectin' on my life, I'm Keanu in Parabellum (Parabellum)
(Heard him s— I heard him s— I heard him say)
Came a long way from where you was
Up-and-comer with a buzz, overcame sellin' drugs
Overcame depression, even overcame addiction
And had the courage to say what others wouldn't with conviction
Always in the kitchen, never mind who be bitchin' (Mind who be bitchin')
I saw a kid with no smile on his face today
"Where is my place in this bright future?" I heard him say
Never mind who be bitchin'
This is for the person in the back who always gon' listen
Fuck a punchline, this is food for thought like the lunch line
We all got problems, the question is, can you solve 'em?
Had the courage to face all of 'em and resolve 'em
Shit, I know you can 'cause I did
I know you can 'cause I done it
No matter what the fuck you goin' through, I'ma keep it a hunnid
I know you can overcome it
Baby mama trippin'? I know, I've been there
Boss caught you slippin'? I know, I've been there
Somebody beefin' with you? Man, that shit ain't rare
Just keep it pushin'
I saw a kid with no smile on his face today
"Where is my place in this bright future?" I heard him say
I've been battlin' with my demons
I'm cowardice when I see 'em
I'm powerless, I can't beat 'em
But deep down, I feel like I need 'em
Power is freedom, you can lead 'em but can't feed 'em
Smilin' on my face but I'm dyin' under the surface
What is my purpose? I'm feelin' worthless
Tell me what worth is
My flaws, I happily greet 'em
Imperfections, I love 'em
My enemies, I defeat 'em
Man, I know somebody gon' relate to this
To keeping it real, it's insane, you better pray for this
'Cause I wanted this shit all my life
'Til I finally got it and realized there's so much more to life
Used to dream I'd become the fuckin' man I am
Stackin' money and readin' my son Sam I Am
Love life, can't tell you how much a fan I am
This is grown folk music if you did not know
Thirty somethin', I ain't rappin' 'bout no dumb shit, ho
Keep it real, Bobby boy ain't no kid no more
Now keep it real, Bobby boy ain't no kid no more
Now if you feelin' how I'm feelin', let a motherfucker know
I saw a kid with no smile on his face today
"Where is my place in this bright future?" I heard him say
This concludes the No Pressure program
No Pressure— Ultra 85, welcome to the Ultra 85 program
This right here for anyone who ride with me
Heard me laugh, watch me cry, did time with me
In the game, not just on the sideline with me
I'm a sinner, I'll admit it, but I got God with me
Been to Hell and back twice just to feel the burn
If your ass don't fall down then you'll never learn
I just wanna be the best that I can be
I just wanna be me, even if it sound naive
I thought acceptance from others it would set me free
But it didn't, no
Oh, no, it never did
No matter what I say, no matter what I give
Sometimes people make me question if I wanna live
We call that a dark day, such a dark day
But I know tomorrow gon' come, it gon' come my way
And I know in my heart it's going to be a better day, it's gon' be a better day
That's why I came here to say
Amen (Amen)
Amen (Amen)
Amen (Amen)
Amen (Amen)
Amen (Amen)
Amen (Amen)
Amen (Amen)
Amen (Amen)
We make plans and God laughs
Feel like the older I get the quicker time pass
Some people live in the past, others live in a flask
Even your picture-perfect life, it could be gone in a flash
Texting on your way to work and now your brains on the dash
We all powerless
'Specially people think power last
I ain't cowardice, but sometimes wish I lived behind a mask
'Cause facing this world it's such a rigorous task
It feel like the world wanna put me in the casket
Wish I was stronger, wish I could just get past it
If you feelin' how I'm feelin' when the song play, blast it
If you feelin' how I'm feelin' when you hear this, let me get an...
Amen (Amen)
Amen (Amen)
Amen (Amen)
Amen (Amen)
Amen (Amen)
Amen (Amen)
Amen (Amen)
Amen (Amen)
This right here for anyone who ride with me
Heard me laugh, watch me cry did time with me
In the game, not just on the sideline with me
I'm a sinner, I'll admit it, but I got God with me
Came up on Section 8 and I made it, yo, mom, look
Writin' these raps in a Louis Vuitton rhyme book
I never thought I'd make it out the hood and now I'm shook
I finally made it out my hood, everybody look
I'm across the street waving where the grass is greener
Hating on how far I've come, I don't give a damn, Gina
This a celebration with no invitation
This the last one then I'm done permanent vacation
Only place I felt I belonged was Babel station
Cooking crack, cooking crack for my generation
Now it's time to conclude the incredible true story, a transformation
Salutations
This is Logic
I've spoken these words before but not on the radio
To be born free is to be born in debt
To live in freedom without fighting slavery
To profiteer
I have met Southerners who expect and fear a Negro insurrection
I see no purpose in withholding this from general discussion
There may be those within that outcast ten percent of the American people who someday will strike back at their oppressors
But to put down that mob, a mob would riot
I'd like to ask, please: who will put down that mob?
I'm an overpaid producer with pleasant reasons to rejoice, and I do
In the wholesome practicability of the profit system
But surely, my right to having more than enough is cancelled
If I don't use that more to help those who have less
I owe the very profit I make to the people I make it from
If this is radicalism, it comes automatically to most of us in show business
It being generally agreed that any public man owes his position to the public
That's what I mean when I say I'm your obedient servant
We must, each day, earn what we own
A healthy man owes to the sick all that he can do for them
An educated man owes to the ignorant all that he can do for them
A free man owes to the world's slaves all that he can do for them
And what is to be done is more, much more, than good works
Christmas baskets, bonuses and tips, and bread and circuses
There is only one thing to be done with slaves
Free them
If we can't die in behalf of progress, we can live for it
Progress, we Americans take to mean, a fuller realization of democracy
The measure of progress, as we understand it, is the measure of equality enjoyed by all men
We can do something about that
The way our fighting brothers and sisters looked at it
Some of them dead as I speak these words
The way they looked at it, we're lucky
And they're right, we're lucky to be alive
But only if our lives make life itself worth dying for
We must be worthy of our luck or we are damned
Our lives were spared, but this is merely the silliest of accidents
Unless we put the gift of life to the hard employments of justice
If we waste that gift, we won't have anywhere to hide from the indignation of history
I want to say this
The morality of the auction block is out of date
There is no room in the American century for Jim Crow
Tomorrow's democracy discriminates against discrimination
Its charter won't include the freedom to end freedom
Race hate isn't human nature, race hate is the abandonment of human nature
But this is true
There are alibis for the phenomenal excuses, economic and social
But the brutal fact is simply this
Where the racist lies acceptable, there is corruption
The race haters must be stopped, the lynchings must be stopped
The murders must be avenged
I come in that boy's name and in the name of all, who, in this land of ours, have no voice of their own
I come with a call for action
This is the time for it
I call for action against the cause of riot
It won't surprise me if I'm accused in some quarters of inciting to riot
Well, I'm very interested in riots, I'm very interested in avoiding them
So I call for action against the cause of riots
Law is the best action, the most decisive
It's in the people's power to see to it that what makes lynchings and starts wars is dealt with
Not by well-wishers, but by policemen, and I mean good policemen
Over several generations, maybe there'll be men who can't be weaned away from the fascist vices of race hate
But we should deny such men responsibility in public affairs
Exactly as we deny responsibility to the wretched victims of the drug habit
There are laws against peddling dope
There can be laws against peddling race hate
But every man has the right to his own opinion as an American boasts
But race hate is not an opinion, it's a phobia
It isn't a viewpoint, race hate is a disease
In a people's world, the incurable racist has no rights
He must be deprived of influence in a people's government
He must be segregated, as he himself would segregate the colored and semitic peoples
Anything very big is very simple
If there's a big race question, there's a big answer to it
And a big answer is simple, like the word "no"
America can write her name across this century, and so she will
If we, the people, brown and black and red
Rise now to the great occasion of our brotherhood
It will take courage
It calls for the doing of great deeds, which means the dreaming of great dreams
Giving the world back to its inhabitants is too big a job for the merely practical
No one of us will live to see a blameless peace
We strive and pray and die for what will be here when we're gone
Our children's children are the ancestors of a free people
To the generations: the fight is worth it
And that just about means that my time is up
When my time's up, I remain as always, obediently yours
Arjun Ivatury
