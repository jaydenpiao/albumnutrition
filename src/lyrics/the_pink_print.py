lyrics = '''
Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in vent
I put the heat in vents, man I been competin' since
I look beyond what people sayin', and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher, what they really meant
Cherish these nights, cherish these people
Life is a movie, but there will never be a sequel
And I'm good with that, as long as I'm peaceful
As long as sevens years from now, I'm taking my daughter to preschool
Cherish these days, man do they go quick
Just yesterday, I swear it was '06
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed
I look down, yes I suppose
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel one minute, yeah we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
'Cause I'ma ride out with you still the night is young
We keep goin', we go, we go, we go
We wake back up and do it all again
(And we know, we know) say fuck the world, we ridin' until the end
When all is said and done, look what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it for you
I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence
His sister said, he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him
Why didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'?
'Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same
Even though they know, that I love him
Family ties, broken before me, niggas tryna kill him, he ain't even call me
And that's the reflection of me, yes I get it, I get it, it was all me
I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes, the last day he saw me
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel one minute, yeah we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
'Cause I'ma ride out with you still the night is young
We keep goin', we go, we go, we go
We wake back up and do it all again
(And we know, we know) say fuck the world, we ridin' until the end
When all is said and done, look what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it for you
Let me make this clear I'm not difficult, I'm just 'bout my business
I'm not into fake industry parties, and fake agendas
Rock with people for how they make me feel not what they give me
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness
I love my mother more than life itself, and that's a fact
I'd give it all, if somehow I could just rekindle that
She never understands, why I'm so overprotective
The more I work, the more I feel like, somehow they're neglected
I want 'Caiah to go to college, just to say, "We did it!"
My child with Aaron, would've have been sixteen, any minute
So in some ways I feel like 'Caiah, is the both of them
It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him
And I know Jelani will always love me, and I'll always love him
And I'm just his little sister not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him
Jee we did it, let's leave this imprint
Just finished writing, this is the Pinkprint
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
I lied, I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart
Even though I said I didn't love you
I lied, I lied
Even though I said I didn't need you
I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
Even though I said don't touch me
I lied, I lied
I can't fall for you, can't give my all to you
Can't let you think that I;ma let the game stall for you
Gotta protect me you gotta sweat me
You said you thought you was ready and I said let's see
But I ain't mean that, I need some fucking proof
'Cause what happens if I fall in love then you cut me loose?
You just a heart breaker won't let you break mine
'Cause I'll be smashing windows and cutting them brake lines
I lied
'Cause who knew that if I just let myself go with you
Who knows, who knows, so I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
Even though I said, "Fuck you"
I lied, I lied
I thought eventually you would let me go
That was my insecurities and my ego
Missed my jump shot missed my free throw
Miss the way we kiss miss the D, yo
Man it was good while it lasted
That shit wasn't real it was magic
If it was a record it would have been classic
But fuck you though, orgasmic
I guess this is what I gotta do to keep me from falling
Stalling the truth, who knew what you'd
Do if I let you in?
My mama ain't raised no fool, I
I am not your usual typical type
Who would protect me if I never hide?
Falling so fast I am afraid of you, so I lied
I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh oh
I lied
Ooh baby
Ooh
'Cause who knew that if I just let myself go with you
Here we go again, it's the game we love
Sheets all over the floor and they laced with drugs
You ain't play your cards right, you had the Ace of Clubs
Hit you with the Ace of Spade, in your face, and shrugged
Blood drippin' out your arm on my Asian rugs
We was just planning a wedding, caught cagin' doves
You was just tellin' your mans, that you hate the clubs
Now we in the crying game, heart laced with slugs
Are you alone? Do you need someone?
Is it too late to talk? Did I wait too long?
Thousand words don't change a thing
Is it only three? Three words that you're missing?
Where did you go? Couldn't see
I was too busy
Could've just said no
Where would you go? I think I know
Who-o-o-o-o-o, who-o-o-o-o-o
We're 'bout to play here
We're 'bout to play here
Who-o-o-o-o-o, who-o-o-o-o-o
We're 'bout to play
The crying game
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're 'bout to play here
The crying game
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're 'bout to play here
The crying game
Welcome to the crying game where you lose your soul
Where it ain't no easy cash, you got to use the toll
Ain't no cruise control, you 'bout to lose control
Ain't no smilin' faces here, we slammin' doors and dishes
Sayin' we don't miss each other, but it's all fictitious
Sayin' that we had enough, but enough of what?
Another slap to the face, another uppercut
I'm just abusive by nature, not 'cause I hate ya
Not 'cause I wanna, guess I wanna imitate ya
I know it's hard, I know I intimidate ya
But is you stayin' or goin'?
I couldn't breathe and you ain't even know it
How come you never show it?
All this love you speak of
All I want is to love and to be loved
(To love and to be loved)
I'm losin' a thing
I thought I'd win
And I'm coming undone
'Cause the tears don't end
Where did you go? Couldn't see
I was too busy
Could've just said no
Where would you go? I think I know
Who-o-o-o-o-o, who-o-o-o-o-o
We're 'bout to play here
We're 'bout to play here
Who-o-o-o-o-o, who-o-o-o-o-o
We're 'bout to play
The crying game
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're 'bout to play here
The crying game
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're 'bout to play here
The crying game
Who-o-o-o-o-o, who-o-o-o-o-o
Who-o-o-o-o-o, who-o-o-o-o-o
Get on your knees, get on your knees, get on your knees
Baby, just get on your knees (on your knees)
Say pretty please, say pretty please, say pretty please
Baby just say pretty please
I'll be back at eleven, you just act like a peasant
Got a bow on my panties because my ass is a present
Yeah it's gooder than Meagan, you look good when you're beggin'
I be laughing when you beggin' me, to just put the head in
Let me sit on your face, it's ok you can play with it
When I'm bouncin' it, chill out and don't you make a mistake with it
Let me see what you're workin' with, if you're ridin', I'm murkin' it
Slow grindin', I'm twerkin' it, yeah I bagged him, I Birkin'd it
I don't need a dozen roses
You ain't gotta wine and dine me, no
I don't need a pretty poet
Ooh, gettin' all emotional
You gotta beg for it, beg for it
I wanna see you lookin' up
Baby I'ma need you to beg, beg beg for it
Get on your knees, get on your knees, get on your knees
Baby, just get on your knees (on your knees)
Say pretty please, say pretty please, say pretty please
Baby just say pretty please (pretty please)
Gimme brain, assume the position
Make me way smarter like you was a magician
Paid my dues and tuition, it's good for your nutrition
Good head like a beautician, got me twitchin', finish your mission
Finish your mission, you make it come down, make it run down
I'ma need you to give these other dudes the run down
You got that legendary, this shit is fake, scary
Got me seein' them fireworks, I'm on my Kate Perry
I don't need a dozen roses
You ain't gotta wine and dine me, no
I don't need a pretty poet
Ooh, gettin' all emotional
You gotta beg for it, beg for it
I wanna see you lookin' up
Baby I'ma need you to beg, beg beg for it (I need you to beg) (let's go)
'Cause we are just animals
Baby it's primal
I want you on all fours
And before I let you walk, you gotta show me how you crawl
If you want it all
It's non negotiable
So do as I say (I say)
If you wanna get the job, you better know who's the boss
I don't need a dozen roses
You ain't gotta wine and dine me, no
I don't need a pretty poet
Ooh, gettin' all emotional
You gotta beg for it, beg for it (beg for it)
I wanna see you lookin' up (lookin' up)
Baby I'ma need you to beg, beg beg for it
Get on your knees, get on your knees, get on your knees
Baby, just get on your knees (on your knees)
Say pretty please, say pretty please, say pretty please
Baby just say pretty please (pretty please)
Yo B, they ready
Let's go
Feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself
I'm feelin' my, feelin' myself
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my, feelin' my, feelin' myself
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my, feelin' myself
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my
I'm with some hood girls lookin' back at it
And a good girl in my tax bracket
Got a black card that'll let Saks have it
These Chanel bags is a bad habit
I-I do balls, Dal Mavericks, my Maybach, black matted
Bitch, never left but I'm back at it
And I'm feelin' myself, jack rabbit
Feelin' myself, back off, 'cause I'm feelin' myself, jack off
Heard he thinks about me when he whacks off
Wax on? Wax off
National anthem hats off, then I curve that nigga, like a bad toss
Lemme get a number 2, with some Mac sauce
On The Run Tour, with my mask off
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself
I'm feelin' my, feelin' myself
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my, feelin' my, feelin' myself
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my, feelin' myself
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my
Changed the game with that digital drop
Know where you was when that digital popped
I stopped the world
Male or female, it make no difference
I stop the world, world stop
Carry on
Kitty on fleek, pretty on fleek
Pretty gang, always keep them niggas on geek
Ridin'-ridin' through Texas (Texas), feed him for his breakfast (uh)
Every time I whip it, I be talkin' so reckless
He said, "Damn Nicki it's tight, " I say, "Yeah nigga you right"
He say "Damn, bae, you so little, but you be really takin' that pipe"
I say, "Yes daddy I do, gimme brain like NYU"
I said, "Teach me, nigga, teach me, all this learnin' here is by you"
I'm whippin' that work, he diggin' that work
I got it, 36 of that real
Panky full of that bounce baby
Come get you some of that bounce baby
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' myself
I'm feelin' my, feelin' myself
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my, feelin' my, feelin' myself
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my, feelin' myself
I'm feelin' myself, I'm feelin' my
Cookin' up the base, lookin' like a kilo
He just wanna taste, biggin' up my ego
Ego, ego, ego, ego, ego, ego, ego, ego
Ridin' through Texas, smokin' all off
Talkin' bout that high-grade, baby hold up
I can heal your migraine
Bitches ain't got punchlines or flow
I have both and an empire also
He gettin' gifts from Santa Claus at the North Pole
Today I'm icy, but I'm prayin' for some more snow
Let that ho ho, let that ho know, he in love with that coco
Why these bitches don't never be learnin'
You bitches will never get what I be earnin'
I'm still gettin' plaques, from my records that's urban
Ain't gotta rely on top 40
I am a rap legend, just go ask the kings of rap
Who is the queen and things of that
Nature, look at my finger, that is a glacier, hits like a lazer
Trippin' on that work, trippin' off that purp
Flippin' up my skirt and I be whippin' all that work
Takin' trips with all them ki's, car keys got b's
Stingin' with the Queen B and we be whippin' all that D
Cause we dope girls we flawless, we the poster girls for all this
We run around with them ballers, only real niggas on my call list
I'm the big kahuna, go let them whores know
Just on this song alone, bitch is on her fourth flow
You like it don't you? Snitches!
Young money
Yo, I never fucked Wayne, I never fucked Drake
All my life, man, fuck's sake
If I did I menage with 'em
And let 'em eat my ass like a cupcake
My man full, he just ate, I don't duck nobody but tape
Yeah, that was a set up for a punchline on duct tape
Worried bout if my butt fake
Worried 'bout y'all niggas, us straight
These girls are my sons, John and Kate plus Eight
When I walk in, sit up straight, I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5 is my idea of an update
Hut one, hut two, big titties, big butt too
Fuck with them real niggas who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is, ring finger where the rock is
These hoes couldn't test me even if their name was pop quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with, mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens unless they last name is cutlet
Let it soak in, like seasonin'
And tell 'em, bitches blow me, Lance Stephenson
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only
I never fucked Nicki 'cause she got a man
But when that's over then I'm the first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought goddamn, this is the perfect time
We had just come from that video
You know LA traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt
But I was still staring at the titties though
Yeah, low-key or may be high-key
I been peeped that you like me you know
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn't take much for us to do this shit quietly, I mean
She say I'm obsessed with thick women and I agree, yeha
That's right I like my girls BBW, yeah
Type that wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you, yeah
So thick that everyone else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Claire Huxtable
Oh, yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you
The bad ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you
Oh, that's 'cause I believe in something, and I stand for it
And Nicki if you ever tryna fuck
Just give me the heads up so I can plan for it (Pinkprint, ayy)
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only
I never fucked Nick' and that's fucked up
If I did fuck she'd be fucked up
Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right
'Cause she actin' like she need dick in her life
That's another story, I'm no story teller
I piss greatness like gold is yellow
All my goons so overzealous
I'm from Hollygroove, the holy Mecca
Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she wave
They bet' not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? I take mothers instead
You got the hickups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp boy, treat beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' bout runnin' in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, messed up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy my nigga, I mean brazy my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it my nigga
Blood gang, take the "b" off behavior, my nigga for reals
If you mouth off, I blow your face off
I mean pop-pop-pop, then I take off
Now you see me, nigga now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx, acting like Ray Charles
Sixteen in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bully with seventeen bullets
My story is how I went from "poor me"
To "please pour me a drink and celebrate with me"
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only
Want some more

One minute they hate me then they love me

Who had Eminem on the first album?
Who had Kanye saying, "She a problem"?
Who the fuck came in the game made her own cologne?
Who made Lil Wayne give 'em five million?
Why the fuck I gotta say it, though?
You niggas don't know it yet?
Football touchdown on the Boeing jet
You my son, but I'm just not showing yet
Wrist icy, but it ain't snowing yet
You can tell I'm the illest 'cause my dividend is the biggest
Bitches ain't sitting with us, all my niggas in Margielas (oh!)
Is pigs flying? Is these bitches trying me?
They think it's sweet? Oh, these bitches got diabetes
You seen that list? It was me, Baby, Jay Z and Diddy
Want-want-want-want some more
Want some more
Even though a nigga been getting to it
Want some more

Every time I end up getting it
Want-want-want-want some more (yo)
I'm in this bitch I'm high-saditty
I popped a Perc and I said thank you
I'm popping tags everyday, it look like my B-Day
These bitches suck, so I nickname these bitches BJ
They want that union, they want that D. Wade
I tell a ho just be happy they getting leeway
My name Barbie, bitch (my name Barbie, bitch)
Alexander, made me Queen
I'm pulling up with the King, I'm late to my own party, bitch
Want it, I get it, I don't be wanting for nothing
I mean, I do what I do and it must be counting for something
I don't be jumping from topic to topic, stay in my pocket
I got your rent in my pocket, so can I pay you to pop it?
Cash Money, getting six albums
No bitch niggas on a bitch album
You niggas apologize when a nigga diss you?
That's a big problem
Want-want-want-want some more

Even though a nigga been getting to it
Want-want-want-want some more
(Still want some more)

You know that you need a rider
You know that you need a rider, babe
You know that you need a rider
You know that you need a rider, babe, ah yeah
Yo, I just wanna be ya rider
You should pull up in that Spyder

And I ain't talking about the fighter
Get it lit without a lighter
Let's pull an all-nighter
Tell me-tell me what you need, got the weed
I'm a bad little bitch and I never indict her
Get locked, I'ma write ya
You on the road? I'ma Skype ya
I don't wanna hype ya
But you a lucky nigga if my mean ass like ya
You ain't never have a bitch understand you
Most of them wanna use you and they ran through
I just wanna be somebody that can add to
Your wife, be a friend, be a teacher and a fan too
I just wanna listen
When you leave I say, "Damn, I fucking miss him"
I just wanna be your vixen
Give you something real wet to put your lips in
I wanna be the only one that can check you
And still respect you
'Cause it's you I would change for, you always make sure
I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be your favorite
Won't you let me be your favorite?
Ayo, I just wanna be your first go to
Do you like a real one supposed to, livin' bi-coastal
Scoop me in the truck, late night, on a humble
Meet me out in Queens or the city when it's sundown
You could put your gun down, you could have fun now
You could tell your niggas that you won now, one down
Run through the clubs with the baddest
Bitches is the maddest, nothin' else matters
And they say Birkin where the bag is
Gotta lot of bags, but we never got baggage
Winter Wonderland on my hands, call me Alice, balance
I'ma have you coming in my palace
London, Tokyo, Paris
Let me update your status
'Cause it's you I would change for, you always make sure
I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be your favorite

Won't you let me be your favorite?

Anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody wanna buy a heart?
(You should say it right now, should say it right now)
Anybody wanna buy a heart?
'Cause I don't use the shit anyway
But okay, I guess it's my fault
Woah! Westside shorty, with an Eastside nigga
They say it's levels to this shit, I'm a G5 nigga
And every city I be in, you know she fly with us
It's like Hov got Bey, it's like Bey got Jigga
Really though let me take y'all back
'09, Double R drop top with the top down
Pulled up, double parked, hopped out, tried to spit my game
It didn't work, got shot down
But I can tell by the bag, by the wrist, and the ring on that
Somebody had it on lockdown
The moral of the story not to speak on that
She on the team, shorty mine now
And we don't ever ever ever make love
And we don't ever ever ever say "love"

Rihmeek, I'ma have to tell the truth if I speak
Unless you want to play, you ain't say this the other day
You said she was in love, and I still didn't budge
'Cause I already seen how you be going in when you be in them clubs
(I'm not even sure if this is right but, it feels good)
I could tell you was analyzing me, I could tell you was criticizing me
I could tell you was fantasizing
That you would come slide in me and confide in me
He could tell that I was wifey material
He was liking my style in my videos
I wasn't looking for love I was looking for a buzz
So at times I would lie and say I'm busy, yo
'Cause it's too much, and it's too clutch
Who wants rumors of the two of us?
But when you're away I can't get you out of my mind
But what if I'm not the one and you're wasting your time
Anybody? Anybody?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?

Do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud, but I'ma remain icon-stat
Balenciagas on my boots with the python strap
You was caught up in the rush, and you was caught up in the thrill of it
You was with me way before I hit a quarter mill' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, man, you got me poppin' pills in it
I told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'
'Cause I was doing it for us, I told 'em fuck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating
Overdosin', no more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked all along
I'ma ask on the song
Do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And you know how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears roll down it's like you ain't even notice 'em
If you had a heart, I was hoping that you would show it some
What the fuck you really telling me? What you telling me?
I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony
This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked, all along
I'ma ask on the song
So does she know I've been in that bed before?
A thousand count, and not a single thread of truth
If I was just another girl
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
There's one thing I need to know
So call me when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself
Do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
Am I just a fool?
Blind and stupid for loving you
Am I just a silly girl?
So young and naive to think you were
The one who came to take claim of this heart
Cold hearted shame you'll remain just afraid in the dark
And now the people are talking
The people are saying that you have been playing my heart
Like a grand piano
The people are talking
The people are saying that you have been playing my heart
Like a grand piano
So play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on
Am I Queen of Fools?
Wrapped up in lies and foolish jewels
What do I see in you?
Maybe I'm addicted to all the things you do
'Cause I keep thinking you were
The one who came to take claim of this heart
Cold-hearted shame you'll remain just afraid in the dark
The people are talking
The people are saying that you have been playing my heart
Like a grand piano
The people are talking
The people are saying that you have been playing my heart
Like a grand piano
So play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on

You ain't gotta leave
But you can't sleep with me
Every time I come and fuck with you
You make up all the rules
You ought to do it
Just because our car's moving
Are you in my fucking corner for real?
Or, are you plotting to kill?
I tell you just how I feel, feel
But you never hear
Oh, why you take it like that?
Now you wanna leave and never come back
I don't control you, I ain't never say that
Can't give up on you, baby, we go way back
Put you in a room
You ain't gotta leave
You ain't gotta leave
But you can't sleep with me
Every time I try to fuck with you
Nothing ain't ever enough for you
And I had all this hope for you
But all you do is open wounds
I could be fucking with them other niggas
And no you ain't them other niggas
I don't fuck with a lot of bitches
Just my real bitches
Why you keep talking about it? You keep talking and you gon' get me pissed off
Motherfuckers who be wanting that bitch to go crazy if she could cut her wrist off
I ain't finna lie, no I ain't finna lie like it was just his fault
But I know if a nigga lose me, then nigga, oohwee, that's his loss, young nigga
Put you in a room
You ain't gotta leave
You ain't gotta leave
But you can't sleep with me
Put you in a room
You ain't gotta leave
You ain't gotta leave
But you can't sleep with me
Uh, thinkin' out loud
I must have a quarter million on me right now
Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm 'bout is talkin' blunt and staying blunted
Pretty women, are you here? Are you here right now, huh?
We should all disappear right now
Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car
And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?
You see the fleet of all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things
Niggas see me rollin' and their mood change
Like a motherfucker
New flow, I got a dozen of 'em
I don't trust you, you are undercover
I could probably make some step-sisters fuck each other
Talkin' filets with the truffle butter
Fresh sheets and towels, man she gotta love it
Yeah, they all get what they desire from it
What, tell them niggas we ain't hidin' from it
Yo, thinkin' out loud
I must have about a milli' on me right now
And I ain't talkin' about that Lil Wayne record
I'm still the highest sellin' female rapper, for the record
Man, this a sixty-five million single sold
I ain't gotta compete with a single soul
I'm good with the ballpoint game, finger roll
Ask me how to do it, I don't tell a single soul
Pretty women, wassup? Is you here right now?
You a stand-up or is you in your chair, right now uh?
Do you hear me?
I can't let a wack nigga get near me
I might kiss the baddest bitch, if you dare me
I ain't never need a man, to take care of me
Yo, I'm in that big boy, bitches can't rent this
I floss everyday, but I ain't a dentist
Your whole style and approach, I invented
And I ain't takin' that back, 'cause I meant it
Uh, thinkin' out loud
I could be broke and keep a million dollar smile
LOL to the bank checkin' my account
Bank teller flirtin' after checkin' my account
Pretty ladies, are you here?
Truffle butter on your pussy
Cuddle buddies on the low
You ain't gotta tell your friend
That I eat it in the morning
'Cause she gonna say "I know"
Can I hit it in the bathroom?
Put your hands on the toilet
I'll put one leg on the tub
Girl, this my new dance move
I just don't know what to call it
But bitch you dancing with the stars
I ain't nothin' like your last dude
What's his name? Not important
I bought some Cocaine, if you snortin'
She became a vacuum
Put it on my dick like carpet
Suck the white off like chocolate
I'm so heartless, thoughtless, lawless and flawless
Smallest regardless, largest in charge
And born in New Orleans, get killed for Jordans
Skateboard, I'm gnarly, Drake, Tunechi and Barbie you know
