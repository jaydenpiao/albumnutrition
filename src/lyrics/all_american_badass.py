lyrics = '''
Yeah (wake up, wake up)
Free your mind (I said wake up)
Good morning America
Good morning America (I said wake up)
Good morning America
Now, what's freedom to you?
Let's talk about it, take a minute, think it through
I'm all about it, but the concept seems loose
The cops will still shoot us down on Channel 5 news
Lock us up for anything we do to pay dues
Some of us woke while some stay snooze
Zombies walking around trippin' over its shoes
The knowledge is official but it's often misused
America my masseuse, massaging my back
Tryna' act like, she ain't gonna do me like Pratt
Geronimo, take a leap and lay flat
I'm down to go for my message to spread across the map
Holy, cross on my back got a bullseye on it
I gotta get stoned to fulfill my moment
Oppress my oppressor, suppress the opponent
Channel my ancestor, he wouldn't condone it
In search of the healing components that you would notice
If you took notice, but you too nosey
Time to wake up
Won't you come and smell the hot coffee
Stick your nose in the wrong places, no wonder you OD
I swear the whole world on me
I'm nothing close to the old me
If you never knew me then it's too late to be homies
Homie say fuck what you told me
I'm riding all by my lonely
Waiting for the big homie to take these chains off me
I came from
A dream
That the black man dream is long ago
I'm actually a therapist
Sent to you by your ancestors
You know
Yeah
Always wanted to have super powers
You know, uh
It's for my people, tryin' stay alive and just stay peaceful
So hard to survive a world so lethal
Who will take a stand and be our hero
For my people, yeah
It's for my people, tryin' to stay alive and just stay peaceful
So hard to survive a world so lethal
Who will take a stand and be our hero
Uh, not all heroes don't wear capes
And all villains don't get away
But all limits eventually fade
I don't wanna be good, nigga I'm tryin' to be great
It's hard when your back's against the wall
And if you got an order keep your feet up on the floor
That's why I thank the Lord when I wake up in the morn'
'Cause through him you can see every reason I was born
You can see the power when the mic is in my palm
When I storm across the room, hit the stage and perform
Word is bond, don't be alarmed
Don't let me have to sound a horn, and drop a bomb
Want to get my mom a crib, with a lawn
Something that my future kids, can run up on
That's why I always do my best to carry on
Heaven's like game of chess, don't be a pawn my nigga
It's for my people, tryin' to stay alive and just stay peaceful
So hard to survive a world so lethal
Who will take a stand and be our hero
For my people, yeah
It's for my people, tryin' to stay alive and just stay peaceful
So hard to survive a world so lethal
Who will take a stand and be our hero
Look up in the sky, it's a bird it's a plane
No, it's the young black God livin' out his dreams
What you mean I been up on an ultralight beam
They don't wanna see you fly, they just gonna shoot your wings
Everything, ain't what it seem
Wishing all these dirty cops, would come clean
Still swerving on these city blocks, for one thing
I may just cop the 30 shot, protect the team, know what I mean?
Music is a form of expression
I'mma use mine just to teach you a lesson
Rule one: this microphone's a weapon
I'm shootin' out the actions manifested in my passion
Influencing and surpassing, they expect to see a life in my direction
Man that section 8 depressin'
Hard to be progression through recession and oppression
Not to mention that they had our soul blocked ever since an adolescent
It's for my people, tryin' to stay alive and just stay peaceful
So hard to survive a world so lethal
Who will take the stand and be our hero
For my people, yeah
It's for my people, tryin' to stay alive and just stay peaceful
So hard to survive a world so lethal
Who will take the stand and be our hero
Oh, mm
I come here to talk about how I feel
And I feel like that we are treated differently than other people
And I don't like how we are treated
Just because of our colour, doesn't mean anything to me
This just the way I feel
Mind's been racing so long
It's just no way to deal
With these problems alone
And I really can't take it no more
I be fighting temptations, my Lord
I'm making them restless (and I really can't help it)
I never felt selfish before
I've been living so reckless, I know
Tell me Lord can you help me?
(I said Lord can you help me?)
Now everybody got problems, yeah
But ain't no way to solve 'em
I really came up from the bottom
Strugglin', my momma on her last dollar
Hustling man I've been putting in these hours
The government been trying to take away what's ours
It's really all about the money and the power
I just wanna see my people in power
Uh, uh, tell me how we gon' shape this vision
Complainin' all day, but in the same condition
If you wanna make change, it's gon' take commitment
Some people enslaved by they religion
Can't emancipate the fundamental prisons
When I see through optics, transform the wisdom
Watch me use my powers, get 'em all to listen
I've been on a mission, ah!
And I really can't take it no more
I be fighting temptations, my Lord
I'm making them restless (and I really can't help it)
I never felt selfish before
I've been living so reckless, I know
Tell me Lord can you help me?
(I said Lord can you help me?)
Now everybody got vice (vice), yeah
But wouldn't know what good advice was (advice was)
Uh, until they leave him lifeless
Another momma crying, it's another crisis
Lord knows we just trying to live righteous
Are you willing just to make the sacrifices?
I know we can't continue living like this
And I never sell my soul because that's priceless
Uh, uh tell me how we gon' make a living
Hustle on the block who gon' save the children?
Menace on the block and I'm just revealing
The media just trying to make a villain
I just take the pain and a paint a picture
Voices in my head, I hear the whispers
When I feel this way inhale the swisher
Or I sip the liquor, ah!
And I really can't take it no more
I be fighting temptations, my Lord
I'm making them restless (and I really can't help it)
I never felt selfish before
I've been living so reckless I know
Tell me Lord can you help me?
(I said Lord can you help me?)
This just the way I feel
Mind's been racing so long
It's just no way to deal
With these problems alone
And I really can't take it no more
I be fighting temptations, my Lord
I'm making them restless (I said Lord, can you help me?)
I never felt selfish before
I've been living so reckless, I know
Tell me Lord can you help me?
(I said Lord can you help me?)
Do not stop
We are black people and we shouldn't have to feel like this
We shouldn't have to protest because y'all are treating us wrong
We do this because we need to have rights
Yeah
You know sometimes I think they don't truly understand me you know
'Cause they don't
Can't change the world 'less we change ourselves
Die from the sicknesses if we don't seek the health
All eyes be my witness when I speak what's felt
Full house on my hands, the cards I was dealt
Three K's, Two A's in AmeriKKKa
I'm just a black spade spawn out the nebula
And everything I do or say today that's worthwhile
Will for sure inspire action in your first child
I'll begin my verse now
Sometimes I speak and I feel like it ain't my words
Like I'm just a vessel channeling inside this universe
I feel my ancestors arrested inside of me
It's like they want me to shoot my chance and change society
But how do I go about it? Tell me where I start?
My destiny rerouted when I chose to follow heart
You told to follow suit, but tell me what it do for you?
Except weigh you down, now you trapped inside the cubicle they built for us
The first step in the change is to take notice
Realize the real games that they tried to show us
300 plus years of them cold shoulders
Yet 300 million of us still got no focus
Sorry America, but I will not be your soldier
Obama just wasn't enough, I just need some more closure
And Donald Trump is not equipped to take this country over
Let's face facts 'cause we know what's the real motives
In the land of the free, is for the free loaders
Leave us dead in the street then be your organ donors
They disorganized my people, made us all loners
Still got the last names of our slave owners
In the land of the free, it's for the free loaders
Leave us dead in the street then be your organ donors
They disorganized my people, made us all loners
We can't change the world 'less we change ourselves
Die from the sicknesses if we don't seek the health
All eyes be my witness when I speak what's felt
Full house on my hands, the cards I was dealt
Three K's, Two A's in AmeriKKKa
I'm just a black spade spawn out the nebula
And everything I do or say today that's worthwhile
Will for sure inspire action
Trickery in the system, put my niggas in prison
All our history hidden, ain't no liberty given
We all fit the description of what the documents written
We been lacking the vision and barely making a living
We too worried to fit in while they been benefitin'
Every time you submittin', we all guilty admit it
The Lord won't get you acquitted, but you still ask for forgiveness
Put opiates in syringes then inject his religion
How many times do I gotta tell you I'm a man on a mission
Many times I gotta tell you I don't need no permission
Or human with supervision, ain't no livin' condition
I'm reaching out to my children, just hoping that they will listen
Start a new coalition against corrupt politicians
It's not enough pots to piss in, too many murder convictions
Another family evicted, another black man a victim
That's as real as it's getting, you should take recognition
In the land of the free, is for the free loaders
Leave us dead in the street then be your organ donors
They disorganized my people, made us all loners
Still got the last names of our slave owners
In the land of the free, is for the free loaders
Leave us dead in the street then be your organ donors
They disorganized my people, made us all loners
We can't change the world 'less we change ourselves
Die from the sicknesses if we don't seek the health
All eyes be my witness when I speak what's felt
Full house on my hands, the cards I was dealt
Three K's, Two A's in AmeriKKKa
I'm just a black spade spawn out the nebula
And everything I do or say today that's worthwhile
Will for sure inspire action in your first child
I used to feel so devastated
At times I thought we'd never make it
But now we on our way to greatness
And all that ever took was patience
I-I-I-I used to feel so devastated
At times I thought we'd never make it, yeah
But now we on our way to greatness
And all that ever took was patience
Okay, just getting better each day
Stacking that cheddar, cheese cake
Looking up to the Lord, we pray
Trying to be my best each day
Until I'm laid to rest we lay, yeah
'Til the time being we lit
Hoping I don't let it get all in my head
I don't need money just to say that I'm rich
Couple little honeys wanna get in my bed
But they used to run from me when I had nothing
Now they want to fuck 'cause they see me stuntin'
Nigga came up off the hustling
Living in a life of lux and I'm feeling like the man
If you ain't in my Chucks, then you wouldn't understand homie
'Bout these rubber bands on me
Make her wanna dance for me
Probably leave her man for me
Standing in the stairs Goddamn
(She used to front way back, now she just a fan)
I used to feel so devastated
At times I thought we'd never make it, yeah
Now we on our way to greatness
And all that ever took was patience
I-I-I-I used to feel so devastated
At times I thought we'd never make it, yeah
But now we on our way to greatness
And all that ever took was patience
I put my pain in a cadence
Turn my brain up a wavelength
Now we're flowing the ceiling
So just go with the feeling
Baby soak up the vibe
Let's roll some dope up, get high
We gon' blow smoke in the sky
'Til we can't open our eyes
I put my pain in a cadence
Turn my brain up a wavelength
Now we're flowing the ceiling
So just go with the feeling
Baby soak up the vibe
Let's roll some dope up, get high
We gon' blow smoke in the sky
'Til we can't open our eyes
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Skr, skr
I used to feel so devastated
At times I thought we'd never make it, yeah
Now we on our way to greatness
And all that ever took was patience
I-I-I-I used to feel so devastated
At times I thought we'd never make it, yeah
But now we on our way to greatness
And all that ever took was patience
I used to feel so (so devastated)
At times I thought we'd (we'd never make it)
But now we on our way
And all that ever took was patience
[Intro]
Oh, oh, ayy
Oh, oh, ayy
Oh, oh, ayy
Oh, oh, ayy
Ayy
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
Tell me why you don’t love me
Why you always misjudge me?
Why you always put so many things above me?
Why you lead me to believe that I’m ugly?
Why you never trust me?
Why you treat me like I don’t matter?
Why you always kicking my ladder?
Why you never hearing my side to the story?
Never look me in my eyes, say sorry?

[Verse]
Why you can't recognize my stride?
Always gotta minimize my pride
Always gon' criticize my moods
I can't make one mistake, it's no room
Feelin' like I gotta leave real soon
I'ma say, "Namaste," and just bloom
But for now, let you run away from the truths
Since you can do anything you want to, anyway, uh
Know some things I ain't supposed to know
It's way deeper than just bein' emotional
Some things you just couldn't keep on the low
Now I'm free, by the truth, I can't be controlled, no more
Nothin' like I used to be back before
Know it must hurt for you to see me evolve
Why you gotta kick me down on all fours?
Why you can't stand to see me stand tall?
Tell me why we got a war?
Why we gotta fight? Why we always gotta spar for?
Why the cops always gotta get called?
Why you always tryna see me in trouble with the law?
I guess some things will never change
Locked in the cycle, tryna break the chains
Handcuffs so tight, nearly slit my veins
This what tough love feels like, feel my pain, uh

[Chorus]
Tell me why you don’t love me
Why you always misjudge me?
Why you always put so many things above me?
Why you lead me to believe that I’m ugly?
Why you never trust me?
Why you treat me like I don’t matter?
Why you always kicking my ladder?
Why you never hearing my side to the story?
Never look me in my eyes, say sorry?

[Outro]
Because Amerikkka don't love me
Whole country turned on me
It's no love in the city for the homie
Just a gang of police, praying they don't ever catch it on me
'Cause Amerikkka don't love me
Whole country turned on me
It's no love in the city for the homie
Just a gang of police, praying they don't ever catch it on me
Because Amerikkka don't love me
Whole country turned on me
It's no love in the city for the homie
Just a gang of police, praying they don't ever catch it on me
'Cause Amerikkka don't love me
Whole country turned on me
It's no love in the city for the homie
Just a gang of police, praying they don't ever catch it on me

[Outro]
Okay, okay you red, white and blue
Now you no good Miss America
How you like this shit, huh?
[Joey Bada$$:]
Yeah, yeah
I said niggas pop shit all the time
Me I don't trip 'cause they know I'm never lyin'
Lookin' between the lines
Feel like Ali in his prime
As-Salaam-Alaikum, alaikum salaam
Peace to my Slimes, and peace to my Crips
Neighborhood police and they always on the shift
Protect my Bloods, look out for my cause
When it's all said and done, we be the realest there was
Who else if just not us?
If you 'bout this revolution, please stand up
We ain't got no one to trust
Time is running up, feel the burn in my gut
And if you got the guts, scream, "Fuck Donald Trump"
We don't give a fuck, never had one to give
Never will forget, probably never will forgive
Uh, I guess that's just how it is
And they still won't let the Black man live

Feel the energy surge through my veins when I flow
Mentally, I can never be controlled
No sympathy for foes, my enemies exposed
Will they remember me when I'm gone?
I say rockabye, rockabye, rockabye baby
Shotta boy, shotta boy, shotta go crazy
Me nuh play games, so please don't play me
Look at what they made me

[ScHoolboy Q:]
I'm part of the reason they still Crippin' out in Brooklyn
Before I was an artist I would book 'em, mm
Push ya shit back while on them front line, nigga, ya lunch time
I'm by them stop sign, you love that wi-fi
On mamas for them dirty dollars, brains on collars
Park the car around the corner, I'll be there in a second
The murder weapon on me, fuck if this bitch start flamin'
The cops patrollin', get that punk ass American flag ceremony
Aww, damn am I going too far?
Give you some flavor to borrow
Bitch yeah it came with the car
It's off-white, leveled the hard
You ball, might come with a charge
Your kids don't know you no more
Your girl's draws stay on the floor
No phone call accepted in weeks
Your son picked up on your beef, real shit
From gettin' lynched in field into ownin' buildings
Getting millions, influencin' white children
And oddly we still ain't even
Still a small percentage of blacks that's eating
Same routines, the same dope fiends
Them nightmare dreams, forever murder season
Bad intentions to them picket fences
They gave us guns but won't hire us, nigga?
So we killin' senseless
Homies murked on the bus benches
Retaliation 'cause his mama cryin'
Kept it gangsta 'til I modify 'em
Rockabye, rockabye

[Joey Bada$$:]
Feel the energy surge through my veins when I flow
Mentally, I can never be controlled
No sympathy for foes, my enemies exposed
Will they remember me when I'm gone?
I say rockabye, rockabye, rockabye baby
Shotta boy, shotta boy, shotta go crazy
Me nuh play games, so please don't play me
Look at what they made me
I was born runnin' with the baton
Now I'm known as the young intellectual don
Until I'm gone, where I'm from, the real don't get along
With the fake, look me in the face, eyes of the storm
You don't want none
No beef could never hurt me
I be on my Istanbul, they cold turkey
Firstly, it's the double entendre monster
Takin' haunted constant trips through your conscious
So be cautious
If it call for it, we leavin' corpses
The causes of the coffin is the broken clauses
Skeletons in my closet, tomorrow's never promised
Never mind it because we immortals regardless
Real G's move in silence like my designer
Intertwined with the timeless, divine higher powered
I was drippin' in the gold since a minor
Sittin' on my throne overlookin' my empire, uh, uh
Resurrection of real, you niggas fake
Never second-guessin' my kill, so choose your fate
'Cause I'm born runnin' with the baton, a tickin' time bomb
Nigga, better ring the alarm, uh
Resurrection of real, you niggas fake
Never second-guessin' my kill, so choose your fate
'Cause I'm born runnin' with the baton, a tickin' time bomb
Nigga, better ring the alarm, uh
So keep it spinnin', disc jocker
Flick the wrist, don't risk that, partner
These niggas impostors, we movin' like the mobsters
One false move, have 'em sleepin' with the lobsters, huh
So keep it spinnin', disc jocker
Flick the wrist, don't risk that, partner
These niggas impostors, we movin' like the mobsters
One false move, have 'em sleepin' with the...
It's the ALL-AMERIKKKAN BADA$$
Who you mad at? They ain't have to ask that
Attack with the backlash, where's my cash at?
Runnin' all through NASDAQ, strap in my backpack
Goin' off the knack, dopeboy in the Cadilac
Havin' flashbacks, wish a nigga would clap back
Hit 'em with the blackjack, goin' through a stack fast
I snap with the raps, I make 'em bring the whole track back
Niggas get smacked with the realer
When I drop, it's all killer, no feelings
So you better not make a wrong move, nigga
I'll personally deliver each shot that won't miss ya
And when it hit ya, it's no warnin'
We bombardin', me and my squadron
If you want it, get your army
We droppin' bombs calmly
This is no party
Any scraps left, we just feed 'em to the zombies
Death before dishonor, I die for my brethren
This is a stick-up, ocean's 47
Ring the alarm, if a war yuh wan get in
Ring the alarm, if a war yuh wan get in
Death before dishonor, I die for my brethren
This is a stick-up, ocean's 47
Ring the alarm, if a war yuh wan get in
Ring the alarm, if a war yuh wan get in
Ring the alarm, we ain't keepin' it calm
Need a reason to see the dog, break the leash and I'm on
Was hungry when I started, more ravenous as I evolve
Caution hazardous, inflictin' damages, I can't recall, uh
Rich in spirit when I broke some laws
I'm breakin' even with my Pros against all the oddsMade my words cut deep, you gon' need some gauze
And that alcohol, we only goin' bar for bar
You know I blacked out, they bring the track out, I lay the smack down
Remember nights on the dirty mattress in the trap house?
I snap out 'em and flipped it around to where I'm at now
Livin' legend, finally back up on the map now
Resurrection of real, let's bring it back
It ain't even about the bars, they bumpin' whatever slaps now
All I hear is that ad-lib rappin' on my SoundCloud
Sick of the trash out, this is the crackdown
Likkle bwoy dun backshot we'll bury ya
Big metal ting ya get Captain Amerikkka
Beast coat regime (La Cosa Nostra)
My team supreme (Fuck around and smoke ya)
Death before dishonor, I die for my brethren
This is a stick-up, ocean's 47
Ring the alarm, if a war yuh wan get in
Ring the alarm, if a war yuh wan get in
Yeah, just ride with a nigga
America's number one, you can bet on ya life!
Statik Selektah
Ride with a nigga like
America’s number one, you can bet on ya life!

Call me the general, pushing that new agenda through
For my millennials, troubled youth and the felons too
Tryna be perennial, but chance of livin' is minimal
She critical, exactly what made my niggas criminals
Typical AmeriKKKa, damn sure ain't no miracle
Word to Steezy, I’ma keep this shit lyrical
'Til I fall out my physical, all my verses is biblical, uh
Flowin' religiously, my delivery spiritual, uh
Feelin' invincible, this here is nothin' new
This is just principle, take notes, if I were you
They say I'm a clumsy king, how I be droppin' jewels
But see, the funny thing is I got lots to lose
Never no fucks to give, only one life to live
So I exchange my negative for a positive and it's all
Good Lord, the pen is way mighty than the sword
Who want war? I told you before

How I kicked in the door
With the rugged raw, back just to reinstall
What you niggas thought it was?
Yes, I’m a veteran, you just a comer up
I can teach you a lesson
How to get your hunger up
Homie ya
How I kicked in the door
With the rugged raw back just to reinstall
What you niggas thought it was?
Yes, I’m a veteran, you just a come up
About to teach you a lesson
How to get your fuckin' hunger up, nigga

Badmon, we ah run tings, yeah
Never let the tings run we, uh
All di gyal dem a come pree
But mi tell them that the buddy never come free
Badmon, we ah run tings, yeah
Never let the tings run we, uh
All di gyal dem a come pree
But mi tell them that the buddy never come free

Super predator, filthy AmeriKKKa
Burn the newspapers and the editors
My dead presidents ain’t dead enough
Blew a zip to the head, still ain't red enough
Pray to Jesus, hope he got you
No I'm not a chicken, I never listen to FOX News
Niggas built the country but never givin' they props due
Payin’ for my people, I'm still payin' for my pops dues
I'm royalty, my momma said it
I'm gold hearted, I'm scum headed
Lost soul in a promised land of promises
Gotta mask on, but no, I'm not anonymous
Built on my lonely, no accomplices
Light a L up for my accomplishments
I'm a real nigga, it's not a lot of 'em
If they were, then the cops probably shot at 'em
Badmon, we ah run tings, yeah
Never let the tings run we, uh
All di gyal dem a come pree
But mi tell them that the buddy never come free
Badmon, we ah run tings, yeah
Never let the tings run we, uh
All di gyal dem a come pree
But mi tell them that the buddy never come free
Yeah, I stomp the grounds in my Timberlands
Ain't nothin' colder than New York when that December in
The coldest shoulders, from average Joes and the simple mans
I pack the heat 'cause I'm known around to be simmerin'
That mean I'm finna hit the boilin' point like real soon
Man, I've been heatin' up, my self esteem been on the moon
The flow is hotter than volcanic craters near the equator
Any debaters is simply haters, they know that I'm greater
I be countin' my paper, forever fuck all the majors
Did it all on my own, don't owe nobody no favors
It's clear, I'm heir to the throne, I've been the best in my zone
Internationally known, forever Brooklyn's own
I mean, come on, but here's for the Presidents, the Congressmen, the Senators
Who got us all slavin' while they reapin' all the benefits
Got the world thinkin' that it's true 'bout what they said of us
AmeriKKKa's worst nightmare, the super predator
[Intro: Joey Bada$$]
Yo yo
Badmon representin'
Yo yo
They say you never know what you got
'Til it's all up and away
And it's so lonely at the top
Sometimes you wanna throw it away
But lately I've been talking to God
He told me Heaven is a way better place
So I'm taking everything that I've got
And I'm running away, I'm running away
I just can't cope with the pain
You just won't understand
Running away (away from here)
I'm running away
I just can't cope with the pain
You just won't understand
Running away (away from here)

Gone like the wind, I can't seem to win
I know the end is near, but I just don't know when
Turn on to CNN, look at what I see again
It's another black man, died at the white hand of justice
To tell the truth, man, I'm fuckin' disgusted
I fear for the lives, for my sisters, my brothers
Less fortunate than I, let's formulate a plan
I'm sick of holdin' grudges, I'm loadin' in all my slugs and
Aimin' it at the judges, fuck the cops
Fuck the system and the government, you fuckers not
Protectin' and servin'
You more like damagin' and hurtin'
And letting off shots 'til you motherfuckers certain
He ain't breathin', you made it clear
"Fuck your breath, nigga," don't even deserve air
Don't even deserve shit, don't even deserve nothin'
If black lives really mattered, you niggas would do somethin'
Instead we mean nothin', in fact, we being hunted
They don't want us in abundance
They know it's strength in them numbers
That's why they gave you one
The time is comin', no discussion
If you ain't got a gun, then you better start runnin'
Run to the rock of my salvation (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Run to the stone that the builder rejected (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I run to aboriginal, Christ, Haile Selassie
Hear them call some other name
Them other guy nuh qualified
A long long time mi see ah idiot a try
Tell me America is the land of the free, that's a lie
'Cause nobody, nuh free 'bout yah
Bet how we leave Babylon, and go ah Ethiopia
And if you don't believe we can achieve that
Then you is just another idiot or another
Motherfucker, it's the J-O-Z-I-F B-A-D-M-O-N
Come on, bring them M's on in
I'm on the upside now, you can turn 'em M's upside down
We 'bout to win, there's an L for the other side of him
Most greats that you lost, I invite 'em in
To my soul, don't you feel the vibes when I'm channelin'?
The innermost of my spirit been engulfed with plenty gold
'Cause most of them labels throw pennies so
Who you think investin' in penitentiaries though?
Same owners as them labels, same owners of your cable
Spoon feedin' you fables, tryna keep your mind stable
Your eyes blind, and your skin's hazel
The truth is under your nasal but even the air's all fucked up
How we supposed to see stars? Chemical trails above us
Plus bunch of other shit that's undiscovered
Detached from the roots since we set sail, my brothers
That's word to motherland, sold us on stolen land
Visions from brother man, he seen us all holdin' hands
Fifty years later, still see my brothers choked to death
R.I.P. to Eric Garner, only right I show respect
Nowaday they hangin' us by a different tree
Branches of the government, I can name all three
Judicial, legislative and executive
Lock your pops away, your moms, then next the kids
It's all consecutive, I'm just tryna break the cycle
I wonder if I'll do it all before they take my life, yo
Crucify my image, the Lord is my witness
If them Heaven's gates closed
I'ma break all them hinges for my niggas
Yes, I'ma break all the hinges for my niggas
Yes, I'ma break all the hinges for my niggas
Yes, I'ma break all
They say you never know what you got
'Til it's all up and away
And it's so lonely at the top
Sometimes you wanna throw it away
But lately I've been talking to God
He told me Heaven is a way better place
So I'm taking everything that I've got
And I'm running away, I'm running away
I just can't cope with the pain
You just won't understand
Running away (away from here)
I'm running away
I just can't cope with the pain
You just won't understand
Running away (away from here)
As fast as I can to Mount Zion
I'm running away (I'm running away)
I'm running away (I'm running away)
I'm running away (I'm running away)
I'm running away (I'm running away)
I'm running away (I'm running away)
I'm running away (I'm running away)
Running away (I'm running away)
Away, running away
You better start running, running
Babylon boy them ah coming, coming yeah
You better start running, running
Babylon is coming
Babylon get jealous of we, of we
Just because I walk this way
Babylon get jealous of we, of we
Yeah, uh
Yeah
Yeah, uh
Yeah

This is legendary
Always been my mission, never secondary
Gettin' better every January, it's very scary
They gon' recognize eventually, I take it if they don't give it to me
Swear all of it was written for me (yep, yep)
By a higher conscious spiritually (up, up)
Up and away, jump on a plane, get on my wave right now
I want you believe not only in me, but have some faith in yourself
I wish you peace and good health, happiness and some wealth
I threw a coin in the well, 'cause I was feelin' so well
A token of how I felt, never heard if it fell
Not a noise, not a sound, still no reason to doubt
Quality what I sell, quantity in the sales
Quantum physics myself, count a million atoms of cells
This life I'm livin' it out, damn right, my vision is now
Don't let the prisoner cell build a strut to break out
My brothers at the brick house, the undercovers stakeout
Can't you see it's a trap? The type of shit I think 'bout
I sensed they needed my help, that's why I had to reach out
What you think I do it for? My brothers under a spell
It's clear we livin' in hell, the life of a black male
Right out the womb, you come out, and it's a bunch of blackmail
Just waitin' for you to fail, a special room in the jail
With your name, a number on it so you property now
I see it properly now, it's what the poverty 'bout
It's all a game of Monopoly, tryna cop me a house
An elephant in the room until I fit in my tomb
And introduced to my doom, they say the end comin' soon
Legends, they never die
The niggas only multiply
So put your fire up in the sky
'Cause they won't ever kill the light
They say the legends, they never die
The niggas only multiply
So put your fire up in the sky
'Cause they won't ever kill the light

Tables keep turning, which way do I go?
A fire's burning inside of my soul
Tables keep turning, which way do I go?
A fire's burning inside my control
Look, ready for whatever comes
I hope for the best, I taste the peace and pray it never leave my tongue
But yet, before long, the feelings done
Perhaps I was foolish, just like the boy that prays to only see the sun
Maybe, life happens like tides
One minute you're low and feelin' shallow, then all of a sudden you rise
Just, ride the wave, I say to myself
Find a way, the weight of my wealth
It's honestly a lot to bear
I play the game of stackin' knowin' that I ought to share
How much does a man need? How much can he hoard before his greed?
How can a rich father teach humbleness to his seed?
Just questions, the stubborn all get taught tough lessons
I look at all I got like, "What's missin'?"
God is my only guess, 'cause yes, faith relieve the stress
I find peace again when I find Him and see I'm blessed
Real blessed, life has always got me wonderin'
(Wondering, wondering) Am I doin' it right?
Am I hurtin' myself?
Am I wrongin' the ones that love me the most?
What a burden to have
That ain't no way to live
Or maybe it is
Well, maybe it is
Tables keep turning, which way do I go?
A fire's burning inside of my soul
Tables keep turning, which way do I go?
A fire's burning inside my control

[Chorus: Joey Bada$$]
Legends, they never die
The niggas only multiply
So put your fire up in sky
'Cause they won't ever kill the light
They say the legends, they never die
The niggas only multiply
So put your fire up in sky
'Cause they won't ever kill the light

This is legendary, it's never secondary
I'm getting better every January
The idea of it alone is very scary
I kill my enemies by any means necessary
I said, this is legendary, it's never secondary
Getting better every January
The idea of it alone is very scary
I kill my enemies by any means necessary
Yeah, uh, uh
Turn the music up in the headphones
Watch me get gone
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Amerikkkan I don't want hand vibe
I want my hand on my rifle
I'm aiming at my rival, sure to leave him dead on arrival
They say it's all about survival never lacking the vitals
So I kill and kill again, mister give a revival
I'm coming for the title game, but she throwing you topper
Last nigga who tried to foul now facin' a trial
I'mma be here for a while, gettin' richie like Lionel
Now she all up in denial because she gettin' it down
While I'm only gettin' better so she back on my D now
I wanna be down but she denounced
I got my shot and made it, bounce
Now you tryna rebound
I'm living in the now
While the future figure me out, told mommy pick a place and we out
Cause Bed Stuy a little unsafe for me now
That's why I keep the .40 loaded with no safety around
Never thought I'd have to hold it, I'm just holding it down
Protect my neck and my crown, patrol throughout the town
And they judging because my skin color is brown
And for that, they wanna leave me dead in the ground
And have the nerve to blame it all on my background
Sorry white Amerikkka but I'm about to black out
Got a message for the world and I won't back out
So turn the key rash loud
I'm about to spazz out
Watch out, another nigga runnin' in the White House
But I won't stop till this whole shit painted in all black
And we on top, because my people been painted before crack
Media's got this whole thing tinted, it's all fat
Feeding you lies like this whole thing wasn't built on our backs
Assimilate our history, then made it a mystery
Now they all inherit the, bittersweet victory
Look at what they did to me, can I get a witness please?
Justice never served reparations never sent to me
It's clear who the enemy, they declare war on the enemy
Assassinate my character, buryin' my entity
But they can't kill my energy, so when it's said and done they forever gon' remember me
The fuck is you tellin' me?
Fuck is you tellin' me?
Way more than a celebrity
And fuck white supremacy
I'm out for
Dead presidents that represent me
Dead fucking presidents that represent me
I'm out for dead presidents that represent me
Because I've never known a live one that represent me
Dead presidents that represent me
I'm out for dead presidents that represent me
Dead fucking presidents that represent me
Because I've never known a live one that represent me
No contest, can't fuck with the congress
Me and my niggas going off like bomb threats
No contest, can't fuck with the congress
Me and my niggas going off like bomb threats
Me and my niggas going off like bomb threats
Me and my niggas going off like bomb threats
Me and my niggas going off
This that Bada$$-assination
Topic of conversation, my proclamation to the nation and its congregation
Been making observations like its my occupation
Debating speculation like it ain't just second nature
Thou shall love thy neighbor, don't let that nigga hate you
'Cause he know where you lay up, when it's karma time to pay up
Climb the ladder of success I'm steady on my way though
Devising plans while you sleepin' I'm just tryna stay woke
You leave me no choice, I'm about to bring noise
Got to fill this void, I got to be the voice
Yeah yeah yeah
I said leave me no choice, about to bring noise
Got to fill this void, I got to be the voice
What the government is doing to most our people is
Downright evil but not surprising, that's for certain
Under the conflict of propaganda, I believe simply trying to slander
Start a Civil War within the USA amongst black and white and those elite
They are simply pushing us to our limit so that we can all get together and get with it
They want us to rebel, so that it makes easier for them to kill us and put us in jails
Alton Sterlings are happening every day in this country and around the world
The scary part, boys and girls, is most of these stories
Don't make it to the news and reach mass consciousness
It is for sure time that we as a people stand up for
Acknowledgement and accomplishment of what we call human rights
It is time to rebel, better yet, raise hell
I just want everyone to be cautious about how they go about it
Because this is all part of the government's plan they been plottin'
They're literally begging for this to happen
So they can kill us off using uprising and rebellion as an excuse in a timely fashion
The cancerous foods, the chemical warfare
Economic suffering is not working fast enough
There are many steps ahead of us and manifesting the future that they want
We have to work together, not only rattling them
On a physical plane but to outsmart them
On an intellectual mental level the same
As black men, I think our gangs need to do a better
Job at protecting us, the people, our communities
And not assisting in destroying them brutally
It's time to even the score
'Cause who do we call when the police break the law
We are so quick to pick up a gun and kill one another
But not quick enough to pick it up and protect each other
The code words to killin' a black man by police is "He's got a gun"
Damned if he do, damned if he don't, damned if he runs
Or what about them, them murderers got it
We need solutions, you better start plotting now
It's always been clear that they don't value our lives
My people been suffering way too long, and I'm tired of singing the same old song
People acting like this shit isn't happening, it's downright wrong
Justice won't be served by a hashtag, and that's the very reason I ask that
What are we to do? We're scattered around
With no clue of this ugly truth
All we know is who they ridiculed and who gets minisculed
Time to wake the fuck up and do our own research
And not form opinions based on just what we've heard
Ameri-k-k-k-a is force feeding you lies down your throats with a silver spoon
And eventually, we'll all be doomed
Real, real, real soon
