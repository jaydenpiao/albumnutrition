lyrics = '''
Lord God
I come to you a sinner
And I humbly repent for my sins
I believe that Jesus is Lord
I believe that you raised him from the dead
I will ask that Jesus come to my life
And be my Lord and Savior
I receive Jesus to take control of my life
And that I may live for him from this day forth
Thank you Lord Jesus for saving me with your precious blood
In Jesus' name, Amen
I met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central
She had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta
Ass came with a hump from the jump she was a camel
I want to ride like Arabians
Push an '04 Mercedes-Benz
"Hello my name is Kendrick"
She said "No, you're handsome"
Whispered in my ear, disappeared then found her dancing
Ciara had played in the background
The parade music we made had us all wearing shades now (cool)
"Where you stay?"
She said, "Down the street from Dominguez High"
Okay, I know that's borderline Compton or Paramount
"Well is it Compton?"
"No, " she replied and quickly start batting her eyes and
I strictly had wanted her thighs around me
Seventeen, with nothing but pussy stuck on my mental
My motive was rather sinful
"What you trying to get into?"
She didn't tell, just gave me her Nextel
Dropped the number, we chirped the whole summer and well
The summer had passed and now I'm liking her
Conversation we having probably enticing her
Who could imagine, maybe my actions would end up wifing her
Love or lust, regardless we'll fuck 'cause the trife in us
It's deep-rooted, the music of being young and dumb
Its never muted, in fact it's much louder where I'm from
We know a lot 'bout each other, her mother was a crack addict
She live with her granny and her younger two brothers
Her favorite cousin Demetrius's irrepetible
Family history of gang banging did make me skeptical
But not enough to stop me from getting a nut
"I wanna come over, what's up?"
That's what I told her soon as this episode
Of Martin go off
I'm trying to get off
I was in heat like a cactus, my tactics of being thirsty
Probably could hurt me, but fuck it I got some heart
Grab my momma's keys, hopped in the car, then oh boy
So now I'm down Rosecrans in a Caravan
Passing Alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump
I got enough to get me through the traffic jam
At least I hope cause my pockets broke as a promise man
I'm thinking 'bout that sex, thinking bout her thighs
Or maybe kissing on her neck, or maybe what position's next
Sent a picture of her titties blowing up my texts
I looked at 'em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette
Enthused by the touch of a woman she's a masseuse
And I'm a professional porn star when off the Goose
I had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom
I'm hoping to get her loose like an Uncle Luke Anthem
I'm two blocks away, two hundred and fifty feet
And six steps from where she stay, she waving me 'cross the street
I pulled up a smile on my face, and then I see
Two niggas, two black hoodies, I froze as my phone rang
Please leave your message for 323
Record your message after the tone
Kendrick, where you at?
Damn! I'm sittin' here waitin' on my van
You told me you was gon' be back in fifteen minutes
I gotta go to the county buildin', man
These kids ready to eat! I'm ready to eat, shit
I gotta get them food stamps, come on now
You on you way or what?
I hope you ain't out there messin' with them damn hood-rats out there, shit
Especially that lil' crazy-ass girl Sherane
And plus you got school tomorrow
You keep fuckin' around in them streets
You ain't gon' pass to the next grade, eleventh grade
(Is that Kendrick on the phone?)
Yo' daddy hollerin' about some damn dominoes (lemme holler at me him)
He want to holler at you too, go 'head, Kenny, go! Shit
Kenny! (What?) You on his voicemail! Damn fool (oh) shit!
(K, where my motherfuckin' dominoes at?
This the second time I ask you to bring my fuckin' dominoes!)
Kenny, give me the damn phone, shit, don't hang up! Damn!
Just let meâ€”Kendrick
When you get this message, man, call me back
I need to know when you gon' bring back my damn car
This man fussin' about some damn dominoes
It ain't all that serious, for damn dominoes
Shit, I'ma miss my damn appointment! Fuck!
Fuck them damn dominoes, nobody wanna hear that
Nobody wanna hear yo' ass!
Matter of fact, cut my motherfuckin' oldies back on
You killin' my motherfuckin' vibe
I am a sinner
Who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hanging with ya?
Fell on my face and I woke with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people 'round me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me put me on stages
To me that's amazing
To you that's a quick check, with all disrespect let me say this
I am a sinner
Who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
I'm trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
You trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm looking right past ya
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know this is something you can blame
On yourselves you can remain, stuck in a box
I'ma break out and then hide every lock
I'ma break out and then hide every lock
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me put me on stages
To me that's amazing
To you that's a quick check, with all disrespect let me say this
I am a sinner
Who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
You ain't heard the coast like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line?
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
3's in the air I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings now what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My new year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfucking much, I got my drink I got my music
I say bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Uh, Martin had a dream
Martin had a dream
Kendrick have a dream
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours
Goddamn I feel amazing, damn I'm in the matrix
My mind is living on cloud nine and this nine is never on vacation
Start up that Maserati and VROOM VROOM! I'm racing
Poppin' pills in the lobby and I pray they don't find her naked
And I pray you niggas is hatin', shooters go after Judas
Jesus Christ if I live life on my knees, ain't no need to do this
Park it in front of Lueders, next to that Church's Chicken
All you pussies is losers, all my niggas is winners, screaming
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours
Goddamn I got bitches (okay!) damn I got bitches (okay!)
Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead showers
I've got twenty-five lighters on my dresser, yessir
Put fire to that ass, body cast on a stretcher
And her body got that ass that a ruler couldn't measure
And it make me cum fast but I never get embarrassed
And I recognize you have what I've been wanting since that record
That Adina Howard had pop it fast to impress her
She rollin' I'm holding my scrotum and posing
This voice here is golden so fuck y'all I goes in and
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy two hours
Damn I got bitches, damn I got bitches
Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or nigga
It's go time
I roll in dough with a good grind
And I run at ho with a baton
That's a relay race with a bouquet
They say, "K, you goin' marry mines?"
Beeotch! (no way) Beeotch! (no way)
Beeotch! (no way) Beeotch!
Okay, I'm never living life confined
It's a failure even if I'm blind
I can tell ya who what when where how?
To sell ya game right on time
Beeotch! (go play) Beeotch! (go play)
Beeotch! (go play) Beeotch!
I look like OJ, killing everything from pussy to a mothafuckin' Hit-Boy beat
She pussy poppin' and I got options like an audible, I be
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, I win then ball at your defeat
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, my city mobbin' in the street, yellin'
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy two hours
Goddamn I got bitches (okay!) damn I got bitches (okay!)
Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead showers (let it run Ali)
Martin had a dream
Martin had a dream
Kendrick have a dream
Everybody, everybody
Everybody
Everybody sit your bitch ass down and
Listen to this true mothafuckin' story told by Kendrick Lamar on Rosecrans, ya bitch
Smoking on the finest dope
Aye aye aye aye
Drank until I can't no mo'
Aye aye aye aye
Really I'm a sober soul
But I'm with the homies right now
And we ain't asking for no favors
Rush a nigga quick then laugh about it later
Aye aye aye aye
Really I'm a peacemaker
But I'm with the homies right now
And momma used to say
One day, it's gon' burn you out
One day, it's gon' burn you out, out
One day, it's gon' burn you out
One day, it's gon' burn you
I'm with the homies right now
Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, and orange soda
Janky stash box when the federales roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble
I hope the universe love you today
'Cause the energy we bringing sure to carry away
A flock of positive activists and fill the body with hate
If it's necessary
Bumping Jeezy first album looking distracted
Speaking language only we know, you think is an accent
The windows roll down all I see is a hand pass it
Hotboxing like George Foreman grilling the masses
Of the working world, we pulled up on a bunch of working girls
And asked them what they working with, look at me
I got the blunt in my mouth
Usually I'm drug-free, but shit I'm with the homies
Yeah, nigga, we off a pill and Remy Red
Come through and bust ya head, nigga!
Me and the homies
Sag all the way to the liquor store
Where my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more
Me and the homies
I ride for my mothafuckin' niggas
Hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in
Me and the homies
Matter of fact, I hop out that mothafucka
And be like, "Doo-doo-doo-doot, doo-doo-doo-doo-doot!"
It's 2:30 and the sun is beaming
Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screaming
Hungry for anything unhealthy and if nutrition can help me
I'll tell you to suck my dick then I'll continue eating
We speeding on the 405 passing Westchester
You know the light skin girls in all the little dresses, good Lord
They knew we weren't from 'round there
'Cause every time we down there we pulling out the Boost Mobile sim cards
Bougie bitches with no extensions
Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination
Before we sparked a conversation
We seen three niggas in colors we didn't like then started interrogating
I never was a gangbanger, I mean I was never stranger to the funk neither
I really doubt it
Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
That's ironic 'cause I've never been violent, until I'm with the homies
Me and the homies
(Bullshittin', actin' a fool)
Me and the homies
(Trippin', really trippin')
Me and the homies
(Just ridin', just ridin', just ridin'â€¦)
Bragging 'bout the episode we just had
A shot of Hennessey didn't make me feel that bad
I'm usually a true firm believer of bad karma
Consequences from evil will make your past haunt you
We tryna conquer the city with disobedience
Quick to turn it up, even if we ain't got the CD in
But Jeezy still playing and our attitude is still "nigga, what is you saying"
Pull in front of the house that we been camping out for like two months
The sun is going down as we take whatever we want
(Aye, aye, nigga, jackpot, nigga, pop the safe!
Ay nigga, I think it's somebody in this room
Wait, what?
Nigga, it's somebody in this room!)
I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo
DVDs, plasma screen TVs in the trunk
We made a right, then made a left, then made a right
Then made a left, we was just circling life
My mama called, "Hello? What you doin'? "Kicking it"
I should've told her I'm probably 'bout to catch my first offense with the homies
But they made a right, they made a left then made a right
Then another right
One lucky night with the homies
K. Dot, you faded, hood?
Yea we finally got that nigga faded I think he hit the wrong blunt though
Ooh, which one?
Well which one he talking 'bout? I was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it
I prayed he hit that
Nah, that nigga straight, he ain't hit that one
Got the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans
Nigga I think we should push back to the city, fo' real doe
Nigga, for what?
What that nigga, what's that Jeezy song say nigga?
"Last time I checked I was the man on these streets!"
Yea, yea, that shit right there, I'm tryna be the nigga in the street
There he go, man you don't even know how the shit go
Look, here's the plan luv, we gon' use the kickback as a alibi
Wait 'til the sun go down, roll out, complete the mission
Drop K. Dot off at his mama van, at the park
Cause I know he tryna fuck on Sherane tonight
Then we all gon' meet back at the block at about 10:30
That's straight but we should meet up around 12, I'm tryna fuck on something too
Nigga sit yo dumb ass back down, nigga you ain't doing shit tonight
Matter fact, nigga get in the mothafuckin' car
We finna get active
Me and my niggas tryna get it, ya bish (ya bish, ya bish)
Hit this house lick tell me is you with it, ya bish (ya bish, ya bish)
Home invasion was persuasive (was persuasive, was persuasive)
From nine to five I know its vacant, ya bish (ya bish, ya bish)
Dreams of living life like rappers do (like rappers do, like rappers do)
Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool (they wasn't cool, they wasn't cool)
I fucked Sherane then went to tell my bros (tell my bros, tell my bros
Then Usher Raymond "Let it Burn" came on ("Let it Burn" came on, "Let it Burn" came on)
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish (ya bish, ya bish)
Parked the car then we start rhyming, ya bish (ya bish, ya bish)
The only thing we had to free our mind (free our mind, free our mind)
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs (dollar signs, dollar signs)
You looking like an easy come up, ya bish (ya bish, ya bish)
A silver spoon I know you come from, ya bish (ya bish, ya bish)
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew (we never knew, we never knew)
Go at a reverend for the revenue
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you do
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever (the one in front of the gun forever)
And I been hustlin' all day, this a way, that a way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel (now, now)
A dollar might, just fuck your main bitch that's just how I feel (now)
A dollar might, say fuck them niggas that you came with that's just how I feel (now, now)
A dollar might, just make that lane switch that's just how I feel (now)
A dollar might, turn to a million and we all rich that's just how I feel
Dreams of living life like rappers do (like rappers do, like rappers do)
Bump that new E-40 at the school (way at the school, way at the school)
You know big ballin' with my homies (my homies)
Earl Stevens had us thinking rational (Thinking rational, that's rational)
Back to reality we poor, ya bish (ya bish, ya bish)
Another casualty at war, ya bish (ya bish, ya bish)
Two bullets in my uncle Tony head (my Tony head, my Tony head)
He said one day I'd be on tour, ya bish (ya bish, ya bish)
That Louis Burger never be the same (won't be the same, won't be the same)
A louis belt will never ease that pain (won't ease that pain, won't ease that pain)
But I'ma purchase when that day is jerkin' (That day is jerkin', day is jerkin')
Pull off at Church's with Pirelli's skirtin' (Pirelli's skirtin', Pirelli's skirtin')
Gang signs out the window, ya bish (ya bish, ya bish)
Hoping all of 'em offend you, ya bish (ya bish, ya bish)
They say your hood is a pot of gold (a pot of gold, a pot of gold)
And we gone crash it when nobodies home
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you do
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever (the one in front of the gun forever)
And I been hustlin' all day, this a way, that a way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel (now, now)
A dollar might, just fuck your main bitch that's just how I feel (now)
A dollar might, say fuck them niggas that you came with that's just how I feel (now, now)
A dollar might, just make that lane switch that's just how I feel (now)
A dollar might, turn to a million and we all rich that's just how I feel
Be the last one out to get this dough? No way
Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way
Hit the brakes, when they on patrol? No way
Be the last one out to get this dough? No way
Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way
Hit the brakes, when they on patrol? No way
Imagine Rock up in the projects where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings, liquor spilling pistols popping
Baking soda YOLA whipping, ain't no turkey on Thanksgiving
My homeboy just domed a nigga, I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue, everyday I'm hustlin'
What else is a thug to do when you eatin' cheese from the government?
Gotta provide for my daughter 'n' 'em, get the fuck up out my way, bitch
Got that drum and got them bands just like a parade, bitch
Drop that work up in the bushes, hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do tell the truth, this the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut, them serpents lurking blood
Bitches selling pussy, niggas selling drugs but it's all good
Broken promises, steal yo' watch and tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a footlocker is
In the streets with a heater under my dungarees
Dreams of me getting shaded under a money tree
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you do
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever (the one in front of the gun forever)
And I been hustlin' all day, this a way, that a way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel
Kendrick, just bring my car back, man
I called in for another appointment
I figured you weren't gonna be back here on time anyways
Look, shit, shit
I just wanna get out the house, man
This man is on one, he feelin' good as a motherfucker
Shit, I'm tryna get my thing goin', too
I'm going to Marilyn house, just bring my car back
Shit, he faded
He feelin' good
Look, listen to him! ('cause you got a big ol' fat ass)
Girl, girl, I want your body, I want your body, 'cause of that big ol' fat ass
See, he high as hell
Shit, he ain't even trippin' off them damn dominoes no more
Just bring the car back! Did somebody say dominoes?
Every second, every minute, man I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch put your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now, put me in the mood
I'm talking 'bout dark room, perfume
Go, go!
I recognize your fragrance (hol' up!)
You ain't never gotta say shit (woo!)
And I know your taste is
A little bit (mmm) high maintenance (ooh)
Everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean I write poems in these songs dedicated to you
When you're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet where your friends and them?
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and
Y'all curled in that little bitty Range I heard that
She wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga don't approach her with that Atari
Nigga that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation, rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs
'Less I write it down for real, P.S
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song
I really hope you play this
'Cause ol' girl you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs and all these one off vacations
You've been taken
Clearly a lot for me to take in
It don't make sense
Young East African Girl, you too busy fucking with your other man
I was trying to put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your mama to the motherland
I could do it, maybe one day
When you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's all right here in the city
And you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life but God damn you got adjusted
I mean I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin, and your big ass in that sundress (ooh!)
Good God, what you doing that walk for?
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less
And we would talk more
And they say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write them down for real
P.S
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song
Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Making sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
Living my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talking poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, it's you looking in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, it's you looking for a maybe
Call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common
And what we have common is pain
I mean you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb and I can see power steering
Sex drive when you swerve, I want that interference
It's coherent, I can hear it, mmhm
That's your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me, mmhm
Breathe slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly
And right before you go blind
P.S
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song
I'm gon' ask you one more time, homie
Where is you from? Or it is a problem (ask him if he here for Sherane)
Ayy, you over here for Sherane, homie?
I don't care who this nigga over here for
If he don't tell me where he from, it's a wrap! I'm sorry
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, we gon' do it like this, okay?
I'ma tell you where I'm from, okay?
You gon' tell me where you from, okay?
Or where your grandma stay, where your mama stay
Or where your daddy stay, okay? Fuck with all this talkin'
As a matter of fact, get out the van, homie!
Get out the car before I snatch you out that motherfucker, homie!
Mass hallucination baby
Ill education baby
Want to reconnect with your elations?
This is your station baby
Look inside these walls and you see them having withdrawals
Of a prisoner on his way
Trapped inside your desire
To fire bullets that stray
Track attire just tell you I'm tired and ran away
I should ask a choir, "What do you require
To sing a song that acquire me to have faith?"
As the record spin I should pray
For the record I recognize that I'm easily prey
I got ate alive yesterday
I got animosity building
It's probably big as a building
Me jumping off of the roof
Is just me playing it safe
But what am I supposed to do?
When the topic is red or blue
And you understand that I ain't
But know I'm accustomed to
Just a couple that look for trouble
And live in the street with rank
No better picture to paint than me walking from bible study
And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
From a function that tooken place
They was wondering if I bang
Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks
I don't mind because one day you'll respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d. city
Mass hallucination baby
Ill education baby
Want to reconnect with your elations?
This is your station baby
All I see is strobe lights
Blinding me in my hindsight
Finding me by myself
Promise me you can help
In all honesty I got time to be copacetic until
You had finally made decision to hold me against my will
It was like a head-on collision that folded me standing still
I can never pick out the difference
And grade a cop on the bill
Every time you clock in the morning
I feel you just want to kill
All my innocence while ignoring my purpose
To persevere as a better person
I know you heard this and probably in fear
But what am I supposed to do?
When the blinking of red and blue
Flash from the top of your roof
And your dog has to say woof
And you ask, "Lift up your shirt"
'Cause you wonder if a tattoo
Of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
Gang files, but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile
I heard them chatter, "He's probably young but I know that he's down"
Step on his neck as hard as your bullet proof vest
He don't mind, he know he'll never respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d. city
Mass hallucination baby
Ill education baby
Want to reconnect with your elations?
This is your station baby
All I see in this room
Twenty Xannies and these 'shrooms
Grown-up candy for pain
Can we live in a sane society?
It's entirely stressful upon my brain
You hired me as a victim
I quietly hope for change
When violence is the rhythm
Inspired me to obtain
The silence in this room
With twenty Xannies and 'shrooms
Some grown-up candy I lost it
I feel it's nothing to lose
The streets sure to release the worst side of my best
Don't mind, 'cause now you ever in debt
To good kid, m.A.A.d. city
Mass hallucination baby
Ill education baby
Want to reconnect with your elations?
This is your station baby
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street I hear
"Yawk! Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!"
"Man down
Where you from, nigga?"
"Fuck who you know, where you from, my nigga?"
"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"
"This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga"
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighing on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, waving your hand out the window, check yo self
Uh, warriors and Conans
Hope euphoria can slow dance with society
The driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where hang out
Now this is not a tape recording saying that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine
Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine
We adapt to crime, pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin up you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump
Pickin' off you suckers, suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from
AK's, AR's, "Aye y'all. Duck"
That's what momma said when we was eatin' that free lunch
Aw man, God damn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce
Now crawl yo' head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just piecin'
BGs up to pre-approve, bodies on top of bodies
IV's on top of IV's
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley
Make sure your colors correct
Make sure you're corporate, or they'll be calling your mother collect
They say the governor collect, all of our taxes except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess
M.A.A.d city
"Man down
Where you from, nigga?"
"Fuck who you know, where you from, my nigga?"
"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"
"This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga"
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street I hear
"Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!
Wake yo' punk ass up!
It ain't nothin but a Compton thang
Chyea
Real simple and plain
"et me teach you some lessons about the street
It ain't nothin but a Compton thang
Chyea
How we do
Fresh outta school cause I was a high school grad
Sleeping in the living room in my momma's pad
Reality struck I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole two nigga's hopped out on foot and dashed
My Pops said I needed a job I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leaving
In fact I got fired 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foaming at the mouth
I was straight tweaking the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleeding
You know the reasons but still won't ever know my life
Kendrick AKA Compton's human sacrifice
Cocaine, weed
Nigga's been mixing shit since the 80's, loc
Sherm sticks, butt-nakeds, dip
Make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton
I'm still in the hood
Loc yeah that's cool
The hood took me under so I follow the rules
But yeah that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doing the same thing
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately
Couple of IV's with the fucking spray-can
Shots in the crowd then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, harsh turn brave
Mount up regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip
Trip, we in the hood still
So loc, grab a strap 'cause yeah, it's so real
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where motherfuckers stand
If I told you I killed a nigga at 16, would you believe me?
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick that you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now & Laters to eat
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of being a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul de sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip, the Children of the Corn
They realizing the option of living a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinking and drive, hit the powder then watch this flame
That arrive in his eye, listen coward, the concept is aim and
They bang it and slide out that bitch with deposits
And the price on his head, the tithes probably go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the rough
Compton, U.S.A. made me an angel on angel dust, what
Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank
Now I done grew up 'round some people living their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask back stroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels
Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular that was my problem
I was in the dark room loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup I see the crowd move
Changing by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me
Nigga why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'ma dive in it
Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank
Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience, if you do not hear me then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now and I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down I'mma drown in some poison abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe
I see the love in her eyes,
I see the feelin' the freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize
This is parental advice then apparently,
I'm over influenced by what you are doin' I thought I was doin' the most then someone said to me
Nigga why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it
Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you, bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you, bang
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
Nigga why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it
Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank
When the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hoping that I can borrow a piece of mind
I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright
And a fight he tried to put up, but the type
Of bullet that stuck had went against his will
As blood spilled on your hands
My plans rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back whispering, "Get 'em"
I got 'em, and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality that told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover
A passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a young'n
In pajamas and Dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs
Dumb niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child
I'm proud and well devoted
This Piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'ma push it, wherever whenever
And I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop I hope
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it Section.80, the message resembled Brenda's Got a Baby
What's crazy was, I was hearin' about it
But doubted your ignorance, how could you ever
Just put her on blast and shit?
Judging her past and shit?
Well it's completely my future
A nigga behind me right now asking for ass and shit
And I'ma need that forty dollars even if I gotta
Fuck, suck and swallow in the parking lot
Gonzales Park, I'm followed by a married man, a father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tingling keys
Matter of fact he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get em back
To where they used to be then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman, or better yet a leader
You need her to learn something, then you probably need to beat her
That's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted
But fuck that "Sorry for your loss" shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you trying to gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait
Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
Cause I don't need the attention bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away
I know my fate, and I'm on the grind for this cake
I'ma get or die trying, I'm eyeing every male gender with intentions of buying
You lying to these motherfuckers, talking 'bout you can help with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit
When the lights shut off
And its my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
Sometimes I look in a mirror and ask myself
Am I really scared of passing away
If it's today I hope I hear a
Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline
Reekin' the scent of a reaper, ensuring that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon
And if I'm doomed, may the wound
Help my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm sure not why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about
'Cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe 'cause I'm dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the scheme of, wondering when I'ma rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that put me
In a direction to speak on something that's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't trying to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like "It need to be told"
Cursing the life of twenty generations after her soul
Exactly what'd happened if I ain't continue rappin'
Or steady being distracted by money drugs and four
Fives, I count lives all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fighting for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Am I worth it?
Did I put enough work in?
When the lights shut off
And its my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you will sing about me for- (ooh)
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you will sing about me for- (ooh)
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you will sing about me for- (ooh)
Ay, ay, ay, Where you 'bout to go?
Nigga, the homie's brother
Nigga, right here, he gone, my nigga, he gone!
We on the block right now my nigga
Like we, nigga we right here
"Nigga, they just killed the homie's brother, my nigga
We right here on the block, my nigga
Al-alright, nigga, nigga just call me, alright, alright
Just call me back, man, just call me back
Arghh! Fuck!
So what we gon' do, my niggas? What we gon' do?
Bro, we can go back right now, my nigga
Like nigga, I don't give a fuck, my nigga, we can go back right now
Fuck! I'm tired of this shit! I'm tired of fuckin' runnin'
I'm tired of this shit! My brother, homie!
Tired of running
Tired of hunting
My own kind
But retiring nothing
Tires are steady screeching, the driver is rubbing
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dope on the corner
Look at the coroner
Daughter is dead
Mother is mourning her
Strayed bullets
Ak bullets
Resuscitation was waiting patiently but they couldn't
Bring her back
Who got the footage?
Channel 9
Cameras is looking
It's hard to channel your energy when you know you're crooked
Banana clip, split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
How many sins?
I'm running out
How many sins?
I lost count
Dreams of ballin' like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reaper calling
I'm cottonmouth
Money is power, yours is ours
Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
Hope we get rich, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song
A black flower
I'll show you how to
Dye your thirst
Dye your thirst
Dye your thirst
What are we doing?
Who are we fooling?
Hell is hot, fire is proven
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live right just by how to shoot it
Tired of running, choirs is humming
Tell us to visit, we lying about coming
Now back to business, loading the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is viewed
And the beef is bubbling
It's no discussion, hereditary
All of my cousins
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Too many sins
I'm running out
Somebody send
Me a well for the drought
See, all I know, is taking notes
On taking this life for granted
Granted, if he provoke
My best days, I stress days (Lord forgive me for all my sins for I not know)
My best days, I stress days
Say "Fuck the world, " my sex slave
Money, pussy and greed was my next crave
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
Tired of running, tired of running
Tired of tumbling, tired of running
Tired of tumbling
Back once my momma say
"See a pastor, give me a promise
What if today was the rapture, and you completely tarnished
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dying of thirst
You dying of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works"
Fuck! I'm tired of this shit!
I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit!
My brother, homie!
Is that what I think that is?
I know that's not what I think that is
Why are you so angry?
See, you young men are dying of thirst
Do you know what that means?
That means you need water, holy water
You need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord
Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?
Okay, repeat after me
"Lord God, I come to You a sinner."
(Lord God, I come to You a sinner)
"And I humbly repent for my sins"
(And I humbly repent for my sins)
"I believe that Jesus is Lord"
(I believe that Jesus is Lord)
"I believe you raised Him from the dead"
(I believe you raised Him from the dead)
"I would ask that Jesus come into my life"
(I would ask that Jesus come in my life)
"And be my Lord and Savior"
(And be my Lord and Savior)
"I receive Jesus to take control of my life"
(I receive Jesus to take control of my life)
"And that I may live for Him from this day forward"
(And that I may live for Him from this day forward)
"Thank you, Lord Jesus
For saving me with Your precious blood"
(Thank you, Lord Jesus
For saving me with Your precious blood)
"In Jesus name, amen"
(In Jesus name, amen)
Alright now, remember this day
The start of a new life, your real life
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say
When I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air
I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie even if they tell
Sweet lullabies that come with a smell
Of a dozen roses flippin' down the green hill
You living in a world that come with plan B
'Cause plan A never relay a guarantee
And plan C never could say just what it was
And your plans only can pan around love
You love him, you love them, you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love red-bottom and gold they say queen
You love hand-bag on the waist of your jean
You love french tip and trip that pay for
You love bank slip that tell you we paid more
You love a good hand whenever the card dealt
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say
When I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air
I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real ('cause before you know it, everything's gone)
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie even if they fell
Out the sky and your optics turn stale
Where they mold that's green
I can see you fit the bill
Of living in a world that come with Plan B
'Cause Plan A only can make another mistake
And you can't see success coming from plan C
When it all breaks you, you still say you're lovely
And love them and love when you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love fast cars and dead presidents old
You love fast women
You love keepin' control
Of everything you love, you love beef
You love streets, you love runnin', duckin' police
You love your hood, might even love it to death
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say
When I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air
I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real ('cause before you know it, everything's gone)
The reason why I know you very well
'Cause we have the same eyes can't you tell?
The days I tried to cover up and conceal
My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal
When living in a that come with plan B
A scapegoat 'cause plan A don't come free
And plan C just an excuse like because
Or the word "but", but what if I got love
I love them, I love when I love her
I love so much, I love when love hurts
I love first verse 'cause you're the girl I attract
I love second verse 'cause your the homie that packed
Burning like a stove top, they love cooking from scratch
I love what the both of you have to offer
In fact, I love it so much
I don't love anything else
But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself?
To the point I should hate everything I do love
Should I hate living my life inside the club?
Should I hate her for watching me for that reason?
Should I hate him for telling me that I'm seizin'?
Should I hate them for telling me ball out?
Should I hate street credibility I'm talkin' 'bout
Hatin' all money, power, respect in my will
Or hatin' the fact that none of that shit make me real?
Dot, I ain't trippin' off them dominoes no more
Just calling
Sorry to hear what happened to your homeboy
But don't learn the hard way like I did, homie
Any nigga can kill a man, that don't make you a real nigga
Real is responsibility
Real is taking care of your motherfucking family
Real is God, nigga
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say
When I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air
I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real
('Cause before you know it, everything's gone)
Alright, that's all I wanted to tell you
Just make sure you call us back when you get this message
Here go your mama
Boy, you better have my car on full all this time
You done had my damn car, but look I ain't trippin'
Look, the neighbors say they seen you and your little friends
Over there by Food for Less and they was preaching to you
Over there telling you about the good book
'Cause right about now that's what ya'll need
Oh, and Top Dawg called the house too
I guess he want you and Dave to come to the studio
Now look, you take that music business serious, yeah
Put out something me and your dad can step to
Shit, you know we from Chicago, you know that's what we do
Sing my song, it's all for you
Sing my song, it's all for you
Sing my song, it's all for you
Sing my song, it's all for you
Sing my song, it's all for you
Sing my song, it's all for you
Sing my song, it's all for you
Sing my song, it's all for you
Sing my song, it's all for you
Sing my song, it's all for you
Sing my song, it's all for you
Sing my song, it's all for you
Sing my song, it's all for you
Sing my song, it's all for you
Sing my song, it's all for you
Sing my song, it's all for you
If I don't hear from you by tomorrow
I hope you come back and learn from your mistakes
Come back a man
Tell your story to these black and brown kids in Compton
Let 'em know you was just like them
But you still rose from that dark place of violence
Becoming a positive person, but when you do make it
Give back with your words of encouragement
And that's the best way to give back, to your city
And I love you Kendrick
If I don't hear you knocking on the door
You know where I usually leave the key
Alright? Talk to you later, bye
Now everybody serenade the new faith of Kendrick Lamar
This is King Kendrick Lamar
King Kendrick and I meant it, my point intended is raw
Fix your lenses forensics would've told you Kendrick had killed it
Pretend it's a massacre and the masses upon us
And I mastered being the master at dodging your honor
And the chapter that read at 25 I would live dormant like five in the morning
They raid your spot while Kendrick's performing
And if they take everything, know I got
Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine
Ay, Dre what's happening wit' it my nigga
Still I'm at it, peel the plastic off it, you can feel the magic
Still I'm laughing at the critics talking, I can see 'em gagging
When I'm back in the back of my city, back in the 'bach
With a batch of them banging Dre Beats with me, look where I'm at
It's the murder cap' and I'm captain at birthing this gangsta rap
It's a wrap when I'm done and I come a long way from a hundred dollars a month
To a hundred mil' in a day, bitch I'm from
Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine
So come and visit the tire screeching, ambulance, policeman
Won't you spend a weekend on Rosecrans nigga
Khaki creasing, crime increasing on Rosecrans nigga
Kendrick Conan nigga
Where you sword at, hand on the cross and swore that
I do it big as Rasputia for them shooters
Kama Sutra scream fuck your position and make you hold that
I'm trying to stay grounded like four flats
But I know flats and Piru Crip tats
Will swarm on me like a beehive
Hop in the G ride
From the West to the East side
Know that's just how Compton roll
And that's a given
I pass the blunt then pass the torch of course that's my decision
I crash the Porsche then you report that you see me in Benzes
I must report that we import the narcotics you bought it
Then talked about it when crack hit the speakers, the music business
I blow up every time we throw up a record
Depending on what you expecting, I'm sure it's bigger than your religion
Perfected by niggas that manifested music to live in
Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine
So tell that gangster throw his set high
Roll it up in a blunt, I'mma take you on the next high
I did exactly what I wanted that's what made them checks fly
In my direction, you never questioned when I said I
Would be a mogul before I visit 2Pac and Left-eye
Eazy and Aaliyah when I see you we gon' test drive
A Lambo in heaven but for now I'm on the redeye
Flying back to my city cuz I'll forever standby
Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine
Now we can all celebrate
We can all harvest the rap artists of NWA
America target our rap market, as controversy and hate
Harsh realities we in made our music translate
To the coke dealers, the hood rich
And the broke niggas that play
With them gorillas that know killers
That know where you stay
Roll that kush, crack that case, ten bottles of rosÃ©
This was brought to you by Dre
Now every motherfucker in here say:
"Look who's responsible
For taking Compton international
I make 'em holla"
Ayo Just Blaze, good looking homie
Just Blaze
Ain't no city quite like mine, yeah
In the city of Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine
Mom, I finna use the van real quick!
Be back, 15 minutes!
