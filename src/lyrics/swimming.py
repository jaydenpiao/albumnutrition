lyrics = '''
My regrets look just like text I shouldn't send
And I got neighbors, they're more like strangers
We could be friends
I just need a way out of my head
I'll do anything for a way out
Of my head
In my own way, this feel like living
Some alternate reality
And I was just drowning, but now I'm swimming
Through stressful waters to relief
Yeah, all the things I'd do
To spend a little time in hell
And what I won't tell you
I'll prolly never even tell myself
And don't you know that sunshine don't feel right
When you inside all day
I wish it was nice out, but it looked like rain
Grey skies and I'm drifting, not living forever
They told me it only gets better
My regrets look just like text I shouldn't send
And I got neighbor's, they more like strangers
We could be friends
I just need a way out of my head
I'll do anything for a way out
Of my head
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Well, okay
I'm always sayin' I won't change but
I ain't the same
Everything is different, I can't complain
Don't know what you missin'? Shame on you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Shame on you
Everything is strange, that's just a game
Everybody trippin', thrown it away
We was getting lifted, now we getting paid
Shame on you
I pay the cost to see apostrophes
That means it's mine, keep it myself, taking my time
Always into some bullshit, and out of line
Driving with my eyes closed, missing all the signs
Turn the ignition, I'm driven and sittin' pretty
Listenin' to Whitney and whippin' it through the city yeah
Man on a mission, figure it out
Putting way too much on my shoulders, please hold me down
I keep my head above the water (water)
My eyes is gettin' bigger, so the world is gettin' smaller (smaller)
I've been getting richer but that only made me crazy
Mama told me I was different even when I was a baby
That Mercedes through the PA when I pull up, sounded like a concert
Or a, or a monster truck, I'm trippin' but I'm falling up
I always said I want it all, but it's not enough
O-kay
I'm always sayin' I won't change but
I ain't the same
Everything is different, I can't complain
Don't know what you missin'? Shame on you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Shame on you
Everything is strange, that's just a game
Everybody trippin', throwing it away
We was getting lifted, now we getting paid
Shame on you
We only just begun
No, we don't wanna hurt your feelings
I was only just begun
No, we don't wanna
Hurt (hurt) feelings (feelings)
Down go the system, long live the king
Turn the power off and get your water from the spring
I'm bringing everyone with me when shit get iffy
I give a hundred and fifty percent
This is the shit that I'm dealing with, but I wish I forget
Used to be feelin' depressed, now that I'm living and I'm a little obsessed
Yes, high in Jacuzzi's I been hitting the jets
I'm showing her some love she been givin' me sex
Respect the outline, don't fuck around and be the victim of your pride
Why you lyin'? (Why you lyin'?) Tell the truth and step aside
I don't got the time to let it slide (yep)
I'm too grounded, push whips that move mountains, new crib, blue fountains
These are my surroundings
I've been going through it, you just go around it
But it's really not that different when you think about it
I'm always sayin' I won't change but
I ain't the same
Everything is different, I can't complain
Don't know what you missin'? Shame on you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Shame on you
Everything is strange, that's just a game
Everybody trippin', thrown it away
We was getting lifted, now we getting paid
Shame on you
Hurt
Feelings
You can love it, you can leave it
They say you're nothing without it
Don't let them keep you down
What if I don't need it? There's something about it
That just freaks me out
I just want another minute with it, fuck a little, what's the use?
Never superficial you gon' know it when it hit you
Get a little sentimental when I'm off the juice
Yeah, okay we colder than the breeze
But the breeze ain't flowin' like me, motherfucker, hol' up
You don't need to hol' up, yeah
And I can show you how it seem, what it is, what it truly might be
Nothing that you know of, you don't need to hol' up
I'm so above and beyond you, take drugs to make it up
Way up where we on, space shuttle, Elon
Time we don't waste much, fuck and we wake up
Then I have her sing just like CÃ©line Dion
Catch me if you can but, you'll never catch me, damn
Whole lotta, "yes, I am"
All the way in with no exit plan
Already left and the jet don't land
Yeah, the time is ticking
Come take a ride, get inside, this is highly different
I'm talking fly, got the pilot with me
Can I mind my business? Why you trippin'?
Give you somethin' that your eyes can witness
Ooh, too close
I don't understand why you doing the most (ooh)
You can love it, you can leave it
They'll say you're nothing without it
Don't let them keep you down
What if I don't need it? There's something about it
That just freaks me out
I just want another minute with it, fuck a little
What's the use? (what's the use?)
Never superficial, you gon' know it when it hit you
Get a little sentimental when I'm off the juice (turn it up)
Well, I'ma give you what you came for, yeah
Shit, I've worked too hard to have a clue who you are
Set the bar so far above par, we can parlay all day
Crib long range with the yard
I know I should probably pray more, but you gotta love me
'Cause I save the day, spend money
When I had nothing, shit, it wasn't so funny
Made a promise to the homies, nobody'd go hungry
Look how far we came, still they throwin' dirt on my name
But it never worried my brain
Heads turnin' like a hurricane swervin'
Tell the sun, get up outta my shade
They don't get the picture, cut 'em out of my frame, shit
I'm up 30 thou miles plus change
It's been a while but I'm down 'til I'm out
And it is what it is 'til it ain't
Ooh, oh, oh
I just wanna fly, ah
You can love it, you can leave it
And say you're nothing without it
Don't let them keep you down
What if I don't need it? There's something about it
That just freaks me out
I just want another minute with it, fuck a little
What's the use? (what's the use?)
Never superficial, you don't know it when it hit you
Get a little sentimental when I'm off the juice (ooh)
You can love it
It just freaks me out
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Well it ain't perfect but I don't mind
Because it's worth it
Who really has the time at all
It ain't perfect but I don't mind 'cause on the surface I look so fine
But really I'm buggin' buggin' makin' something out of nothing
Yeah, as hard as it gets, cool, calm and collected
Holdin' my breath this, ain't what I expected
Don't argue to death, pull my heart out of my chest
The cards is all on the table I'm callin' it
Don't say it I swallow it
When livin' off of borrowed time
Often I'm on the fence on a line
Addin' up what's on my mind
My feet on the clouds, head on the ground
That we goin' down, bet you know me now
I'm treading water I swear
That if I drown I don't care
They callin' for me from the shore, I need more
Well it ain't perfect but I don't mind
Because it's workin' (is it?, is it?, is it?, is it?, is it?)
Who really has the time at all (is it?, is it?, is it?, is it?, is it?)
It ain't perfect but I don't mind 'cause on the surface I look so fine
But really I'm buggin' buggin' makin' something out of nothing
It feel like the weekend on the Tuesday
I can move days
It's "I got something else to do" day
Always do hate, if I do say
The D'USSE with the homies like it's Kool Aid
Me, I'm just tryna play it cool J (anyways)
Yeah, mind over matter I'm
Purer than alkaline
Bitch stuck on album time
I gotta get out to shine
Fly on the wall, shit I was buggin'
Miss me like you gettin' withdrawal I keep that coming, yeah
I'm treading water I know
If I start movin' I flow
Ain't nothin' new it
Just play it cool baby, just play it cool
You know, cool
Well it ain't perfect but I don't mind
Because it's workin'
Who really has the time, at all
It ain't perfect but I don't mind 'cause on the surface I look so fine
But really I'm buggin' buggin' makin' something out of nothing
Yeah, tell me you love me spin me around
Pretty please pick me up in the air and don't put me down
Seen it all unfold, sat back and watched
Knowin' time don't give a fuck about clocks until they stop
Bare feet, runnin' late, her car is started
Even though the only thing that she driving, a hard bargain
More important is I'm kinda sorta out the door but
She put me back together when I'm out of order
Perfect
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I switched the time zone, but what do I know?
Spending nights hitchhikin', where will I go?
I could fly home with my eyes closed
But it get kinda hard to see, that's no surprise though
And you could find me, I ain't hiding
I don't move my feet when I be gliding
I just slide in and then I roll out
Yeah, well, climbing over that wall
I remember, yes, I remember, yes, I remember it all
Swear the height be too tall so like September I fall (down, down)
Down below, now I know that the medicine be on call, yeah
It's feeling like you hot enough to melt, yeah
Can't trust no one, can't even trust yourself yeah
And I love you, I don't love nobody else, yeah
Tell them they can take that bullshit elsewhere
Self care, I'm treatin' me right, yeah
Hell yeah, we gonna be alright
(We gon' be alright)
I switched the time zone, but what do I know?
Spending nights hitchhikin', where will I go?
I could fly home with my eyes closed
But it get kinda hard to see, that's no surprise though
And you could find me, I ain't hiding
I don't move my feet when I be gliding
I just slide in and then I roll out
Yeah, I been reading them signs
I been losin' my, I been losin' my, I been losin' my mind, yeah
Get the fuck out the way, must be this high to play
It must be nice up above the lights, and what a lovely life that I made, yeah
I know that feelin' like it's in my family tree, yeah
That Mercedes drove me crazy, I was speedin'
Somebody save me from myself, yeah
Tell them they can take that bullshit elsewhere
Self care, we gonna be good
Hell yeah, they lettin' me go
I switched the time zone, but what do I know?
Spending nights hitchhikin', where will I go?
I could fly home with my eyes closed
But it get kinda hard to see, that's no surprise though
And you could find me, I ain't hiding
I don't move my feet when I be gliding
I just slide in and then I roll out
I didn't know, I didn't know
I didn't know, I didn't know, yeah
Well, didn't know what I was missing
Now I see a lil' different
I was thinking too much
Got stuck in oblivion, yeah, yeah
Oblivion, yeah, yeah
Oblivion, yeah, yeah
I got all the time in the world
So for now, I'm just chillin'
Plus, I know it's a, it's a beautiful feeling
In oblivion, yeah, yeah
Oblivion, yeah, yeah
Oblivion, yeah, yeah
Yeah, 'kay, I ride around my city when I come home, yeah
The sun set quickly then get up slow, yeah
My disc connect and upload
Watch it spin around, we just spinnin' round
Let's go and travel through the unknown
We play it cool we know we fucked up, yeah
You keep on sayin' you in love, so
Tell me are you really down?
Are you really down? Yeah
Let's go back to my crib and play some 45's
It's safer there, I know there's still a war outside
We spend our nights all liquored up, our mornings high
Can you feel it now?
Oblivion, yeah, yeah
Oblivion, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oblivion, yeah, yeah
Ooh
I got all the time in the world
So for now I'm just chillin'
Plus, I know it's a, it's a beautiful feelin'
In oblivion, yeah, yeah
Oblivion yeah, yeah
Oblivion, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Well
I got a bone to pick like roses (roses)
I ain't feelin' broken no more
Bought a fist that got spent, I notice
Talkin' shit, I wander through the motives
Wonder who the fuck I'm supposed to be
I ain't worried now 'til I leave
I'm just tryna ride, feel the breeze
With something bad beside next to me
Wind in my face, don't stop now when it feels so great
You can run 'til you slip on the sidewalk
And the same bone you picked on break, that's a motif (that's a motif)
Yeah, when it's comin' right back, so familiar, never been realer
Never felt so damn good where I'm at
I don't know what it's all about, runnin' through the many thoughts that count
Still ain't addin' up, let you know that I've had enough, yeah
Yeah
I put some money on forever, but I (hey)
Don't like to gamble on the weather, so I, just, watch, well
The sun is shinin', I can look at the horizon
The walls keep gettin' wider, I just hope I never find 'em, I know
Hey
Well, these are my wings, these are my wings, yeah
These are my wings, yeah, well
Movin' so fast, the clock look slow (slow)
Water my seeds 'til the flower just grow, yeah
Love so much that my heart get broke
I don't really know how the normal shit go, so
I guess I just play it by ear, silence is all that I hear
Listenin' close as I can, growin' up (123) jump
Nobody holdin' my hand, no
Trust is a problem, never know how, yeah
That's why I just keep to myself
Get what I need, then I'll be out (please help me)
Who can the serve the universe with me
Lucifer is human and so are we
All I ever want is what I need
And that don't include your time and company
Follow me, we on up and up
Remember when I owed a hundred bucks
Now, we look around like what the fuck?
If you don't fuck with me, you fuckin' up
I know I need to watch my temper, so I
Don't ever gamble on the weather but I, just, watch, well, look
The sun is shinin', I can look at the horizon
The walls keep gettin' wider, I just hope I never find 'em, no, no
Hey, well
These are my wings, these are my wings
These are my wings
Somehow we gotta find a way
No matter how many miles it takes
I know it feels so good right now
But it all comes fallin' down
When the night meet the light
Turn to day
Can't stop, yeah, you won't stop
I know just how that feel
When you're on top, 'til the ball drop
You've never seen it be so real
It feels so good right now
But it all comes fallin' down
When the night meets the light
Turn to day
Feel it a little, feel it a lot
I'm swimmin' a bit, but deeper in thought
Keepin' my head on top of my shoulders
Into some shit, I'm out of the box
This the level I'm on
Needin' it all right now when forever is gone
Baby, the weather is strong
Whether it's hot or cold
I'm comin', knockin' on your door
Well, I'ma, I'ma maintain, I'm stayin' so high
Put the lighter all the way up 'til we touchin' the sky
And you know you're dead wrong, you're in love with a lie
All I, all I, all I wanna do is free your mind
We don't see no lines, we don't color inside
It's a very small world, we don't fuck with the size
Yeah, see the bigger picture when it's beneficial
Lovin' how I catch you blow the whistle when you run out of time
Yeah, wakin' up I open up my, eyes
Do you mind if I blow your, mind?
A little closer, baby, don't be, shy
Why you worried that it's gon' be, fine?
I guess it's that kinda day
It's really all I'm tryna say
We don't have a lot of time to waste
Somehow we gotta find a way
Somehow we gotta find a way
No matter how many miles it takes
I know it feels so good right now
But it all comes fallin' down
When the night meet the light
Turn to day
I wouldn't wait forever
Just shoot your shot
We don't need no more, no extras
We all we got
Yeah, yeah
All the lights flickerin', hittin' the right switches
I'm livin' this life different and missin' the flight bullshittin'
I had a plan to change, you can't stand the rain
Little delay, but I came and you're cool with it
I don't trip, flip or lose my grip
And I don't know it all, but I do know this
Before you know me, better know yourself
I've been in this shit so long that it don't smell
I burn the hotel to a castle
Livin' like the king for a grand
I don't do nothin' that's a hassle
Besides, even that castle's made of sand
Just might slip into the sea
Fuck it all if it all ain't me
Maybe we inside the maze
Somehow we gotta find a way, okay
Somehow we gotta find a way
No matter how many miles it takes
I know it feels so good right now
But it all comes fallin' down
When the night meet the light
Turn to day
I wouldn't wait forever
Just shoot your shot
We don't need no more, no extras
We all we got
Yeah, yeah
The world is so small, 'til it ain't (yeah)
I'm building up a wall, 'til it break
She hate it when I call, and it's late
I don't wanna keep you waiting
I hope I never keep you waiting (yeah)
I think I know it all, but I don't
Why you always at the mall when you broke, yeah
And I just wanna ball
Maybe dunk but I've never been tall (yeah)
I might trip, I never fall
God know's I came close (don't try this at home)
I know I probably need to do better
Fuck whoever
Keep my shit together
You never told me being rich was so lonely
Nobody know me, oh well
Hard to complain from this five star hotel
I'm always in a rush, I've been thinking too much but
Keep it on the hush, no one need to know, just us
That's really all it takes
We don't need nothing but today (today, today, today, today)
The world is so small, 'til it ain't
('Til it ain't, 'til it ain't, 'til it ain't)
I'm building up a wall, till it break
('Til it break, 'til it break, 'til it break)
She hate it when I call, and it's it late
(And it's late, and it's late)
I don't wanna keep you waiting (I don't wanna keep you waiting)
I hope I never keep you waiting (I hope I never keep you waiting)
Whoa (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Whoa (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Whoa (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Whoa (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Whoa (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Whoa (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Whoa (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Whoa (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, got a bad attitude
Playing 'til I'm out of moves
No need for shame, I get more peace at slow speeds
Go beat the game, young control freak
It's cold in my veins, I'm below freezing, snow season (made me)
They know that I so need my space
Don't wanna grow old so I smoke just in case
She say that I glow below the waist
And a stroke is just so PGA
All I got is a little bit of space and time
Drawing shapes and lines of the world we made
Tomorrow may be right around the corner but I swear
It's gon' be worth it if I make it, babe
There's somewhere above, you keep reaching up
That's really all it takes (that's really all it takes)
we don't need nothing but today (today, today, today, today)
The world is so small, 'til it ain't
('Til it ain't, 'til it ain't, 'til it ain't)
I'm building up a wall, till it break
('Til it break, 'til it break, 'til it break)
She hate it when I call, and it's it late
(And it's late, and it's late)
I don't wanna keep you waiting (I don't wanna keep you waiting)
I hope I never keep you waiting (I hope I never keep you waiting)
Yeah, nine times out of ten I get it wrong
That's why I wrote this song, told myself to hold on
I can feel my fingers slippin', in a motherfuckin' instant I'll be gone
Do you want it all if it's all mediocre
Staring at the wall and the wall's full of posters
Lookin' at my dreams, and who I wanna be
I guess you gotta see it to believe
Oh, I been a fool, but that's cool, that's what human beings do
Keep your eyes to the sky, never glued to your shoes
Guess there was a time when my mind was consumed
But the sun's coming out now, clouds start to move
Don't tell me nothing but the truth
I'm tired, I don't gotta spare a second
Win or lose, win or lose
I don't keep count, nobody checkin'
We ain't on the same shit, no way
You ain't from my planet, we don't speak the same language
This is an occasion, ain't it?
I'm feeling good and they hate it
Shit, I don't recognize these faces
Yeah, where you from who you came with?
Started in the basement
Made it way above to top now I'm in the spaceship
In a spaceship, shit is spacious
Swear your life is basic
All you do is sit around the house, you getting faded
That ain't entertainment, yeah
You missin' every single shot that you ain't takin'
Hey kid, you could use a little bit of your imagination
It could do you right, improve a life you busy wastin'
Said it's your money if you make it
Otherwise it's just a conversation
Okay, why you always hatin'?
Lacin' up my sneakers I be running out of patience
Yeah, it ain't your money 'till you make it
Otherwise, it's just a conversation
We ain't on the same shit, no way
You ain't from my planet, we don't speak the same language
This is an occasion, ain't it?
I'm feeling good and they hate it
Shit, I don't recognize these faces
Yeah, where you from who you came with?
Started in the basement
Made it way above the top now I'm in the spaceship
In the spaceship, shit is spacious
Everybody famous, everybody wild, everybody dangerous
Gettin' couple dollars now they actin' strange
Now they wanna give a couple statements
When you really about it you don't say shit
Pocket full of aces
Take over my city yeah that's really home invasions
All my homies with me gettin' busy no vacations
They ain't on my wave but they wavy
Stop boy, you runnin' through your savings
Yeah, I just feel amazing
My head up in the clouds but my feet be on the pavement, yeah
It ain't your money 'till you make it
Otherwise, it's just a conversation
We ain't on the same shit, no way
You ain't from my planet, we don't speak the same language
This is an occasion, ain't it?
I'm feeling good and they hate it
Shit, I don't recognize these faces
Yeah, where you from who you came with?
Started in the basement
Made it way above the top now I'm in the spaceship
In the spaceship, shit is spacious

Well, we was fuckin', almost missed my flight

Yeah, goddamn, we was hit last night
Wouldn't you rather get along?
Wouldn't you rather get along?
You was coughin' when you hit my weed
But I've never seen you feel that free
So cute, you wanna be like me
Wouldn't you rather get along?
Wouldn't you rather get along?
Until, until, there is no longer
Let's get lost inside the clouds
And you, you don't gotta work harder
I can calm you down
Yeah, well I was busy when you hit my phone
But you miss me, tell me come back home
Yeah, and you don't really like to sleep alone
But I'm takin' too long
I'm always takin' too long
Baby we don't need a trip, we could be right here
When the shit get weird, we could switch up gears
I wanna see them lips, kiss 'em ear to ear
I wanna hear your song
Ooh, I wanna feel just how you feel
Touch it one more time so I know you're real
We could spin that wheel, wouldn't you rather get along?
Until, until, there is no longer
Let's get lost inside the clouds
And you, you don't gotta work harder
I can calm you down
I think we just might be alright
Thank god

Yeah, used to wanna be a super hero
Fly around with a cape catching bad guys
Now my head underwater but I ain't in the shower and I ain't getting baptised
To the good and the bad times
All the cuts, broken bones and the black eyes
Young motherfucker with a mad mind
Made a couple million off of rap lines
Y'all can't tell me nothing no more
Came from the basement under that floor
You don't come close, you don't even know I'm the goat
You don't even know how I go 'cause I know what you want
All I wanna do is the most
Backflip off the rope, sky hook when I'm in the post
Yeah, my girl too clutch to choke (hmm)
And I ain't calling it quits
You can build a wall with your bricks
I like you talking that shit, it's like this (hmm)
Liquor still in my cup, get faded when I wake up
'Cause everything is too much, so what?
Woke up this morning with a bright idea
(Smoke)
Maybe I can exist forever right here
(Let it run)
Yeah
Okay, okay, well I'ma be here for a while
Longer than I did expect to
I was out of town, getting lost till I was rescued
Now I'm in the clouds, come down when I run out of jet fuel
But I never run out of jet fuel
Well I'ma be here for a while
Longer than I did expect to
I was out of town, getting lost till I was rescued
Now I'm in the clouds, come down when I run out of jet fuel
But I never run out of jet fuel
Hundred-twenty on a car that I don't whip
I don't even pull it up the driveway
Throwin' up shots like I don't miss
Never put a limit on the high stakes
Try to pull my card tell them "Go Fish"
You ain't gonna find a lie in my face
I pick it up and let it go quick
They wanna get pussy f- (uh, oh)
Yeah I don't say nothing that I don't know
Jumping out the womb wearing Polo
Everybody wanna jump in but I'm old school, lone wolf, take em off solo
Yeah, I don't need nobody (I don't need nobody!)
I don't need to be nobody (I don't need to be nobody)
I'm just doing my thing
Kick it at the crib I don't see nobody no
So over there with that bullshit
We don't need it on this side
I'm pulling up in that new shit
You always whippin' that dick ride
I demand your respect
I won't share my connect (no)
Let's get this clear, I am here
I don't care who got next, young vet
Feeling like they forget, I let this slide, this time
Like twenty-five years I've been high and no less
Shit, I know I don't guess
Rather glow I won't stress
Better say that shit with your chest
Okay, okay, well I'ma be here for a while
Longer than I did expect to
I was out of town, getting lost till I was rescued
Now I'm in the clouds, come down when I run out of jet fuel
But I never run out of jet fuel
Well I'ma be here for a while
Longer than I did expect to
I was out of town, getting lost till I was rescued
Now I'm in the clouds, come down when I run out of jet fuel
But I never run out of jet fuel
Fate in your hands
While you're waitin' for me
I'm already there
Already, dear
Now is only now
Head back to the ground, dear
Yeah
(Eric)
Well
I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause a angel's s'posed to fly, and
I ain't askin', "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door
Yeah, okay you gotta jump in to swim
Well, the light was dim in this life of sin
Now every day I wake up and breathe
I don't have it all but that's alright with me
Take it nice and easy, took a flight to see me
Send you back home with a light that's beamin'
The whole team 'bout to figure it out
We ice cold, that's what winter about
And sometimes, sometimes I wish I took a simpler route
Instead of havin' demons that's as big as my house, mhmm
Have a ball with a dribble and bounce
'Cause the party ain't over 'til they're kickin' me out, yeah
Isn't it funny? We can make a lot of money
Buy a lot of things just to feel a lot of ugly
I was yay high and muddy
Lookin' for what was lookin' for me
But I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause a angel's s'posed to fly, and
I ain't askin', "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door
Yeah, they ask me what I'm smilin' for
Well, because I've never been this high before
It's like I never felt alive before
Mhmm, I'd rather have me peace of mind than war
See me and you, we ain't that different
I struck the fuck out and then I came back swingin'
Take my time to finish, mind my business
A life ain't a life 'til you live it
I was diggin' me a hole big enough to bury my soul
Weight of the world, I gotta carry my own
My own, with these songs I can carry you home
I'm right here when you scared and alone
And I ain't never in a hurry
You don't ever gotta worry
Even when it's 7:30 and the time is runnin' low
When your heart get cold
See what's behind all them unturned stones
And I'm a pro when it come to my job
But really I'm just tryna start believin' in God
Now when it gets hard
I don't panic, I don't sound the alarm
Because I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause a angel's s'posed to fly, and
I ain't askin', "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door
I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause a angel's s'posed to fly, and
I ain't askin', "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, um
Yeah, well
You could have the world in the palm of your hands
You still might drop it
And everybody wanna reach inside your pockets
I tell 'em, "Red light, stop it"
Shit, that give me more headaches than alcoholics
There was nothin' in my wallet, just a lot o' dreamin'
I built a crib on top o' the Promised Land, we'll call it even
Hm, I bring more flavor than all the seasons
Winter, spring, summer, fall
The grass is always greener 'til I cut it all
Please leave me to my studies, I give you no applause
My hands been countin' money, and it's hard to be the boss
But somebody gotta do it (it gets so exhausting)
Often with the bullshit, but, baby, I been through it
Enough for the both of us
Don't come over later and we won't let no one close to us
We could be posted up
Yeah
Ok, well, you could have the world in the palm of your hands
You still might drop it
And everybody wanna reach inside your pockets, so it goes
It's like, in every conversation, we the topic
This narcissism, more like narcotics, so it goes
Well, everybody gather 'round
I'm still standing, sit down
Woah-oh
And I know been out (and I know I been out)
But now I'm back in town (but now I'm back in town) so I
Show you the ropes
So it goes, so it goes, so it goes
Da da da da, da da da
Da da da da, da da da
So it goes (yeah) (so it goes)
Da da da da, da da da
Da da da da da, da da da
So it goes
Well, this is a special delivery, comin' to you live with the
Endless artillery, always down to ride
My eyes on the enterprise
Nine lives, never die, fuck a heaven, I'm still gettin' high
Nevermind, did I mention I'm fine?
'Cause her pussy gettin' wetter when the weather dry
Clementine, peelin' off, and everyone get left behind
I'm only 5'7", 'cept I'm feelin' like I'm 7'5"
Damn it, cross planets, interstellar
Never land, not a Jackson, packed with action
So what's happening, my man
No relaxing, kicking back, this ain't exactly in the plan
I can't get no satisfaction, goddamn
They sayin' I been gone too long
I could just tell 'em fuck you, but that come on too strong
My god, it go on and on
Just like a circle, I go back where I'm from
Well, everybody gather 'round
I'm still standing, sit down
Woah-oh
And I know been out (and I know I been out)
Now I'm back in town (now I'm back in town) so I
Show you the ropes
So it goes, so it goes, so it goes
Da da da da, da da da
Da da da da, da da da
So it goes (yeah) (so it goes)
Da da da da, da da da
Da da da da da, da da da
So it goes
