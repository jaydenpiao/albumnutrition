lyrics = '''
My dreams has always gone beyond the crosing of a pond
As a mother, every path I walked was for my son
Challenges were a part of the journey
And what I wanted was an after-thought
The idea of providing his proper chances helped me to never stop moving forward
Forever confronting whatever transations that needed to be injured
To make his position as a way of move secured
Now I smile, feeling assured
My choices were not in vain
Locations and situations constantly change
But my own way forming heart remains
For all the trails and all the pain
The mission is as it always been
For my son to become a man and live free in his American dream

And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people who really dream
See, my shooter pescatarian, but he eat up all the beef (21)
You gave me your ass to kiss, but want the all of me (goddamn)
I stand on business, dot my I's and cross my T's
All I got is these lil' pictures when I think 'bout all the G's (21)
Memories in my head, the devil talkin' to me (on God)
I know Satan down that path, but God walkin' with me
Put your phone light in the air if you done lost a nigga (21)
Kept it solid, ran up a bag and didn't have to cross a nigga (21, 21, 21)
Woah, bulletproof my cars (yeah)
He a homebody, fuck it, kill him in his yard (yeah)
Niggas go to clubs and let down they guard (21)
We got choppers out until we find somewhere to park (on God)
Pussy, hit the cup and nod (21)
Trench hoes used to curve me, now they treat me like I'm God (facts)
I know you want my spot, but you don't wanna play your part (pussy)
If it was up to you, you probably let these niggas starve (21)
I got rich and opened more doors than a doorman (on God)
All the Glocks came with extensions like a sew-in (straight up)
And all these cars came with BBL's and body kits (21)
Claim you a killer, but you still ain't got a body yet (21)
How you that nigga when you can't go where you grew up at? (Pussy)
How that's your nigga when he cap to hoes behind your back? (The fuck?)
Family picture, you can kill me if you spot a rat (on God)
Real rap, this ain't no cap
See, my shooter pescatarian, but he eat up all the beef (21)
You gave me your ass to kiss, but want the all of me (Goddamn)
I stand on business, dot my I's and cross my T's
All I got is these lil' pictures when I think 'bout all the G's (21)
Memories in my head, the devil talkin' to me (on God)
I know Satan down that path, but God walkin' with me
Put your phone light in the air if you done lost a nigga (21)
Kept it solid, ran up a bag and didn't have to cross a nigga (21, 21, 21)
Came from rats and roaches (yeah)
I seen plenty homicides and still kept my focus (21)
Kill you for some clout
And they'll do anything for motion (on God)
We can't let no bitch say that she the one who broke us (facts)
All familiar faces at the table when we toastin' (21)
Every story got a twist
I can put on watches from my shoulder way down to my wrist
I can't wait on no one, I'm a hustler, I won't ask for shit
She gon' look at you less than a man if you ask your bitch (21)
Even if you helped her on her feet (on God)
They take you for granted, better charge your fee (21)
You 'posed to be a woman, that's the better me
How we both pushin' P?
See, my shooter pescatarian, but he eat up all the beef (21)
You gave me your ass to kiss, but want the all of me (goddamn)
I stand on business, dot my I's and cross my T's
All I got is these lil' pictures when I think 'bout all the G's (21)
Memories in my head, the devil talkin' to me (on God)
I know Satan down that path, but God walkin' with me
Put your phone light in the air if you done lost a nigga (21)
Kept it solid, ran up a bag and didn't have to cross a nigga (21, 21, 21)
Wishin' on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishin' on a star, oh
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I'm wishin' on a star
To follow where you are

Woah, woah, woah
Once you cross that line, it ain't no tryin' to fix it
You want me to forgive you, let's be realistic
I can't kick it with your kind like I tore my meniscus
How you go from co-defendant to a fuckin' witness?
They'll stand on couches with you, but won't stand on business
Woah
I watched everybody turn on my brother
Like he ain't have 'em out here flyin' jets and fuckin' bitches
This shit ridiculous
I feel your pain, my brother
I know you from the struggle
I know how hard you hustled just to take care of your mother
I know you took clothes off your back for niggas you call brother
I know how hard it get in this jungle
Tryna prevail without bein' tried like you no sucker
Huh, life's a motherfucker, yeah
I know ain't nobody perfect
But what's the point in makin' it out if all they do is cuff ya?
You know, we be comin' from, like
The worst conditions, the worst circumstances
The trenches, the gutter
And sometimes we be forced to make decisions that we don't even wanna make
It be about survival
At the end of the day, we be havin' good hearts
They just be in bad places
I guess that's life, though
Father God, forgive me for my sins
Take the mask off all my enemies that's out here actin' like my friends
Did some shit I'm prayin' I never gotta do again
I put blood, sweat, and tears inside this win
If I take care of my hood, the prosecutor call me Gotti
Turn my back on the hood, they probably kill me, probably rob me
It's a Catch-22, I'm bein' honest
Hard work, tryna keep the past behind me
I still be havin' flashbacks 'bout Johnny
Fast forward and the major label signed me
Had to hustle, had to focus, perseverance
Mama used to go to TJ Maxx and shop on clearance
Tayman and CJ, I can still feel they spirits
Skinny and Wanwan used to rap, I know they hear it
It ain't that easy, puttin' pain inside of lyrics
Send this up to Heaven so they can clear it
Y'all know, like, real street niggas gon' feel this shit
And I don't want niggas to get misunderstood
'Cause the rules we live by, don't even matter no more
Just a, just a setback for you to come back
Can't hold a nigga down forever
Know what I'm sayin'?
'Til then, we gon' hold this shit down, straight up

Baby, don't be slurpin' when my buddy get out, baby (woah, woah)
Just back up, like (woah, woah, woah, woah)
Don't be nut-holding (woah, woah)
And for all you fuck niggas (woah, woah)
Stay out the way (woah, woah, woah)
On God (woah, woah)

I took a ballerina down to the ball dance
Met a couple ball players, found a ball stance
Now we in the bathroom, she found a ball face
Took some shots and balled out, now how the stall taste?
I can't even go inside, my old hoes might hear
I might need to hit the town, I need you right here, right here
'Til she reached in the trunk and found a nina
I told her, "Baby, that's Nina Simone"
Ayy, drivin' through the liquor store faded, braided
Hands in this motherfucker wavin', hazy
'80s like the '90s and 2000s (tuh-tuh-tuh-tuh-tuh-tuh-tuh)
Drivin' through this motherfucker, wildin'
Ayy, Brady seven pack, they come in bunch

Different presentation to this vibe, you need a keynote
Presi' 'round this motherfucker, I ain't sendin' vetos
Ain't no stoppin' shit or stoppin' licks, them boys on G-O
Battin' out the 504, I saved her name as "Creole"
Balance when I'm on a road, I get the go and T-O
Dominatrix Matrix when she do it like I'm Neo
Shit is off its sockets, they lock in

They gon' lie, they gon' slip and slide, get beside ya
They gon' try, we a hundred deep like Verizon

Red sky bleedin' from my eye
Tides risin' up to new high
I turn my back to the wind
Slowly driftin' away
I hear the night sing, "Welcome to your new-"
Welcome to your new
It's fourth and inches, I'm sendin' a blitz
Live on the toilet, I stay on my shit
You say, "We opps, " but you stay on my dick
My shooter a rapper, I sent him a hit
They be on Twitter like, "When he gon' miss?"
Say I fell off, but I fell in his bitch
Fuck your white flag, I ain't tellin' 'em shit
I play it cool and hand brodie the blick
Blick out your stu' just to show you I'm rich
Now, you can't drop no new music 'cause shit
How you jump right on that song and then snitch?
Nigga, you sassy and wrong as a bitch
Say the wrong thing and get put on that list
This is a warning 'cause Savage don't diss
Better thank me that your ass still exist
'Cause Jesus can't save you from what's in this stick
She don't look good without makeup, I'm stiff
Don't fuck with rappers 'cause most of 'em snitch
Diamonds gon' cover my neck and my fist
Watch on my leg 'cause I ran out of wrists
Draco brown, like a Hershey
Hang out the window and blow 'em a kiss
Hang out the window and wave at his bitch
Gun smoke, I take it far when I'm pissed
Under cover of the darkness (red sky bleedin')
Sunlight moves, awakening (red sky bleedin')
One that stares while one's asleep (red sky bleedin')
Before that's done, it's waking
Don't give a fuck, I'ma rock with my twin
Niggas freeze up when it's time to go spin
Speak on the dead, then, we boxin' you in
Send you to heaven, they kill you again
We killed his buddy, he buckin' again
If they revive 'em, we bust him again
Pistol so big, ain't no tuckin' it in
I got in trouble for tellin' on friends
Rip out your tongue if you're talkin' too much
You gon' get chopped out talkin' to us
Bullet-proof truck 'cause I know they could touch me
Bury the K and it still shoot rusty
Fuck my opps, niggas broke and they musty
All my exes still wanna fuck me
Eliantte on me, this is not lucky
Fry me a nigga like I'm from Kentucky
Remember when pops used to front me
When I see rappers, I do not see rappers, my nigga, I really see lunch meat
Three hundred black on the seat and the Glock on my hip
Ain't no way you could punch me
You ain't really gang, you a flunkie
Send your ass to the store like your aunty, pussy
Under cover of the darkness (red sky bleedin')
Sunlight moves, awakening (red sky bleedin')
One that stares while one's asleep (red sky bleedin')
Before that's done, it's waking
This is really happening
Is this is really happening?

I finally got the fame and fortune that I prayed for
Who would have thought I would emerge from all that gun smoke?
This for all the teenagers that wanna gun tote
'Cause they cheaper in the hood than in the gun store (on God)
You gon' lose a lot of your friends and that's what hurt the most
You can't do nothin' but reminisce about y'all crackin' jokes
You feelin' like nobody love you, I know how that go
You gotta love yourself, lil' nigga, that's gon' help you glow (on God)
I know it might sound lame, but just stay in school (21)
They got a place that they put people who don't follow rules (yeah)
You probably got your mama scared, don't wanna watch the news
Ready to risk your life and freedom for a pair of shoes
Yeah, you say you love your switch, but they don't love you back
You can hug that block all night, it ain't gon' hug you back (facts)
Some of your friends gon' reincarnate and come back as rats (pussy)
And after your candlelight, they ain't gon' give your mama jack
Now your brother kids askin' where they daddy at
So you gotta lie and tell 'em he just took a nap (damn)
You done failed in the streets, so now you tryna rap
But that ain't really workin' for you, so it's back to trap, damn
When it's all said and done
There's some things you can't run from
It's hard to decide
Either live or you die
I, I ask myself was it all worth the risk
'Cause I can't pretend (yeah)
I can't stand the thought of losing you
I know how it feel to see your dawgs stretched out (on God)
And watch him struggle tryna let his last breath out (damn)
You don't wanna do it, but you lost some real niggas that you gotta step out
One more seat left in the car, you gotta help out (yeah)
Niggas stressed out (yeah, yeah)
Probably why I tell the kids to put the guns down (oh, facts)
Gangsta but I still cry when nobody around
Tryna numb the pain, drinkin' bottles 'til I drown ('til I drown, 21)
Never do no suicide
But I'd be lyin' if I said it hadn't crossed my mind
I hurt on the inside and I still act like I'm fine
Why the judge give my nigga Paul all that time? (Free Paul, hey)
Heard they lockin' niggas up for what they put in rhymes
Standin' on this shit (oh), fuck it, I'm still writin' mine (fuck 'em, oh)
This what growth look like, no more committin' crimes (21)
I stayed out the way and made a way for us to grind (21, 21)
When it's all said and done (all said and done)
There's some things you can't run from
It's hard to decide
Either live or you die (live)
I, I ask myself (ask myself) was it all worth the risk (was it all?)
'Cause I can't pretend (yeah)
I can't stand the thought of losing you
All my dawgs too
Forever-ever Eastside (Eastside)
This shit 'posed to be for life (supposed to be for life, 4L)
Jumpin' shit since we was five (21, five)
We got that fire, we was nine, nine
Even though I'm up, up
You can see the pain in my eyes
I mean like fuck love (on God)
But either way, I'm still gon' try
Got me fucked up (21)
Seein' my twin on Channel 5
I, 'cause even gangsters cry
I, I, I
Gangsters cry
Even gangsters cry
I, I, I
Even gangsters cry
(I, I, I)
21, 21
My son, this is your time
I know your heart
And I've watched you rise above many challenges
And you have made me so proud
I pray for many more fulfilling experiences
As you elevate to new levels of growth, purpose, and success
Dreams really do come true
By the grace of the source of life, so be it
