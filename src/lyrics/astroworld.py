lyrics = '''
Rollin', rollin', rollin', got me stargazin' (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sippin' on purp, feelin' like the Barre Baby (it's lit)
Whatever I downed, it got me goin' crazy (yah)
Psychedelics got me goin' crazy (alright)
I was hot as hell up in the heat (yeah, yeah)
Then this storm came in to save my life
Meditate, just got down on my knees (straight up)
Out of nowhere, you came here to stay the night
In the nighttime (woo, yeah)
Rollin', rollin', rollin', got me stargazin' (rollin')
Psychedelics got me goin' crazy (oh no)
Niggas femalin', they excelling (yeah)
Are they intelli'? (what you tellin'?)
We propellin', up top with Ellen, uh (with the choppers)
Kill the jealous with propane repellent
Got me goin' crazy (it's lit)
On tour, we'll tell 'em, we bought the section (gang)
They keep on callin' up, it's getting hectic like we projected
So we cut the plug, he's interjected (got me goin' crazy)
Rollin', rollin', rollin', got me stargazin' (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sippin' on purp, feelin' like the Barre Baby (it's lit)
Whenever I'm down, it got me goin' crazy (yah)
Psychedelics got me goin' crazy
I was hot as hell up in the heat (yeah, yeah)
Then this storm came in to save my life
Meditate, just got down on my knees (straight up)
Out of nowhere, you came here to stay the night
In the nighttime (woo, yeah)
Got me goin' crazy
Ok, I been up for some days, I ain't got time to lay
Just to drown out all these thoughts, I tried all kind of things
If I take you to my past you will be traumatized
Got a thousand kids outside that's tryna come alive
'99, took AstroWorld, it had to relocate
Told the dogs I'd bring it back, it was a seal of faith
Before no car note, baby girl, she played the tourist guide
Got the keys into my city, now she know the rides
Got new money, got new problems, got new enemies
When you make it to the top, it's the amenities
Packin' out Toyota like I'm in the lead
And it ain't a mosh pit if ain't no injuries
I got 'em stage divin' out the nose bleeds
And she hit that booger, sugar 'til her nose bleed
Bounce that shit forever, she on both knees
She was talkin' 'bout forever got a whole week
But she know my baby mama is a trophy
She be throwing up them B's feel like we both bleed
She keep my dick jumpin up, feel like I'm Moby
I'm way too gold for this beef, feel like I'm Kobe
Yeah, this right here is astronomical
I see you picked up all my ways, I feel responsible
They tryna say that all my problems is improbable
They keep itching at my spit, I'm diabolical
You feel me?
What's crackin'?
You already know who it is
Ya' boy, Big Tuck
Freight Train Tuck
Astroworld is now in session, ya understand?
I'm the dean of this here
I got this
Yeah, yeah
Parked at the Days Inn, ain't takin' no days in (yeah)
Don't need a vacation, I need a replacement (alright)
Bustin' the lights out as soon as we came in (it's lit)
What're they talkin' about, what's it pertainin' (yeah, yeah)
Need me a therapist to ask if I'm aging
This M-E-D it feel caved in
All of my demons invadin'
I live paranoid, hesitatin'
They bitin', they bitin', the cadence
Go out their way, it's okay
Just like they dosing the basement
I got a gate with my face in
Brand new, brand new
This new place I got to
New world, new sky
That's so blue, it's black too
New growth, new growth
All these fakes I outgrew
Blue bands, blue bands
Get my cash from drive-thru
Boy you're too flash, too flash
Keep the flash minimal
Bitch, I'm too cold, too cold
See my breath visible
Yeah
Icy cold, it is so, it is so icy cold (yeah)
Mixing the water with cheeses, making the money get mold (yeah)
Trying to be like gang, you better go get it in Vogue (yeah)
Put 84's on lanes, I ride by, you think it is spokes
We did it, we said it, we spoke
We put it out, thought it was smoke, this 504
This is at home, right down the street, from Alamo
Moving in silence don't mean it's movin' slow
Even though the speed got old
Sprinklin' methamphetamines
On the leaves, like the snow
Bet they soak
I'm a new species, tail swings on the road
Come to reach, and lose both
Got springs like a toad
Sum' for free in the tote
Saké drown like round white diamonds
Carats (yah)
Copy sound, mic got two wings, parrot (alright!)
Landing down wind, caught two wings (it's lit!)
Talons scrape, hit the stage, two wings (yeah, yeah!)
Better pray, better pray in two wings (straight up!)
Brand new, brand new
This new place I got to
New world, new sky
That's so blue, it's black too
New growth, new growth
All these fakes I outgrew
Blue bands, blue bands
Get my cash from drive-thru
Boy you're too flash, too flash
Keep the flash minimal
Bitch, I'm too cold, too cold
See my breath visible
Astro, yeah

I tried to show 'em, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Gone on you with the pick and roll
Young LaFlame, he in sicko mode
Woo, made this here with all the ice on in the booth
At the gate outside, when they pull up, they get me loose
Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hoppin' out coupes
This shit way too big, when we pull up give me the loot
(Gimme the loot!)
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two-four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4AM and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
I just landed in, Chase B mixes pop like Jamba Juice
Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose
Some-some-some, someone said
To win the retreat, we all in too deep
P-p-playin' for keeps, don't play us for weak (someone said)
To win the retreat, we all in too deep
P-p-playin' for keeps, don't play us for weak (yeah)
This shit way too formal, y'all know I don't follow suit
Stacey Dash, most of these girls ain't got a clue
All of these hoes I made off records I produced
I might take all my exes and put 'em all in a group
Hit my esés, I need the bootch
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her, "Hop in, you comin' too"
In the 305, bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke
(Don't stop, pop that pussy!)
Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof (uh)
She said, "Where we goin'?" I said, "The moon"
We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool
Now I got her open, it's just the Goose
Who put this shit together? I'm the glue (someone said)
Shorty FaceTimed me out the blue
Someone said (playin' for keeps)
Someone said, motherfuck what someone said
(Don't play us for weak)
Yeah

If you fall for the games then you're the one playin'

And there's too many honeys out here
Feel like I tripped off the drank, that's weird

Rest in peace to Screw, tonight we take it slowly (yeah)
I just took a four to the head like "mane"
Drop the top on the slab, like "mane"
Off the top of the dome like "mane"
Nothin' beating home like "mane"
And the Screw tapes zone like "mane"
I go Pimp C on the phone like "mane"
Flip say Platinum don't do chrome like "mane"
Had the Southside fade, now let the braids hang
This shit SUC, smooth like "mane"
Rest in peace, Screw, like "mane"
Rest in peace to Screw, tonight we take it slowly
Oh my God, I just can feel the love
Drop top with the windows up
Screw found into a national sound because

All gathered in secrecy

Diamonds are the wife of life
All three Rollies look alike
After two you get a hook-up price
Stripper never worked a nine to five
Delta and I ship it overnight
Stop tryna be God almighty
Fuck the money, never leave your people behind
It's never love, no matter what you try
Still can see it comin' down your eyes
'Cause they did not create commandments (ooh, ooh)
When you hustle, always make it fancy (ooh, ooh)

If I love her I'ma pass her on
First rule of war, you find an act of one
You can't win a trophy or a plaque off her
But never turn your back on her
'Cause they did not create commandments
When you hustle, always make it fancy
The signal's far from what you can be
'Cause air traffic controls the landing
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah
You won't succeed tryna learn me
Stick to the roads in my journey
Stay out of court when you got the attorney
She say she love 'em, want to really burn me
Hmm-hmm
Stop tryna be God

Stop tryna be God

That's not who you are

Ice on my neck, flawless baguettes
Hop off a jet, barely get rest
Cash through the month, I get a check
Yves Saint Laurent on my pants and my chest
Chanel, her dress, clean up her mess
I eat her flesh, you know the rest
Count up a hun', cop a Rolex
Shine like the sun, you truly blessed
Two-tone Patek
In the Clearport like I Uber the jets
VVS's on me got my Gucci shirt wet
Put a M in my bag, I'ma get used to these racks
I went to school where they teach you finesse
Five hundred shoes for the drip I invest
I'm the boss man, I keep cash in the desk
Know the coupe fast when it end with a S
Now that I'm home, back off the road
We shut it down, where it ain't so
With checks in the streets, Jay number fours
Saint Laurent feet, put it on toes
Take it with me, double your dose
Covered with angels that's watching my soul
Jet got a bed, it's bigger windows
Said I'll be there in 10, but I got there in four
I feel like I'm chosen, I'm covered in gold
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mm
I left her wide open, no self control
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mm
Took nothing but five minutes, she hopped in and drove
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mm
Ice on my neck, flawless baguettes
Hop off a jet, barely get rest
Cash through the month, I get a check
Yves Saint Laurent on my pants and my chest
Chanel, her dress, clean up her mess
I eat her flesh, you know the rest
Count up a hun', cop a Rolex
Shine like the sun, you truly blessed
Two-tone Pateks
In the Clearport like I Uber the jets
VVS's on me got my Louis shirt wet
It's a M in my bag and get used to these racks
I went to school where they teach you finesse

Bad-bad news, I'm just bad-bad news
Good thing, the two, Bonnie and Clyde
The money and who?
It's bad news, bad-bad for you
But I'm back on the coffee bean
Anything in between (this is all, this is all)
Back of the coffee line
Back-back-back in the bathroom line (this is all)
How would you feel if I had you?
Trust me, you'd be mad too
But shawty, we can be mad cool
Just hit me if anything past due
Your family told you I'm a bad move
Plus I'm already a black dude
Leavin' the bathroom, my hands is half-rinsed
If only a nigga just had sense
Speaking in past tense
It's been a week and a half since
We ain't been speaking and that meant
You feeling free in my absence
I've been going through a lot behind this glass tint, yeah
(This is all, this is all)
Back of the coffee line
Back-back-back in the bathroom line (this is-)
I know they told you I'd be bad for you
Don't worry I'll be back for you
All the money and cars
Stripper hoes and the tattoos, bad news
Back off a coffee bean
Reflecting on all you see (this is all, this is all)
Stressing over award shows
She's stressin' over her wardrobe
Bought the mansion on foreclose
No matter how many tickets your tour sold
You feel this deep in your torso
Feel like someone's readin' your horoscope
Some shit only me and the Lord knows
SOS, that's for those who hear this in morse code
Too many doors closed Cul-de-sacs and foor doors
Still ended up at the North Pole
This is where remorse goes
This shit'll have you in divorce court
Fighting over your seeds, writing over your deeds, sliding over your keys
Alimony and fees, as your lawyer proceeds
To give out bad news
I'm just bad-bad news
Good thing, the two, Bonnie and Clyde
The money and who?
It's bad news, bad-bad for you
But I'm back on the coffee bean
Anything in between (this is all, this is all)
Back of the coffee line
Back-back-back in the bathroom line (this is all)
