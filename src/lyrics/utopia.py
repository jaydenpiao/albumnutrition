lyrics = '''
The situation we are in at this time
Neither a good one, nor is it so unblessed
It can change, it can stay the same
I can say, I can make my claim
Hail, hail, hail
Yeah, okay
This shit is outta control
I'm drivin' through Hell and I done brought snow
It's shinin' in here and I done brought glow
I hear the sirens right out the chateau, run me the info
Tryna hear what you did, not how you came close
'Cause I get bobblehead like I done made pro
I made Italian bread like I done made dough
I be all around the map
Write a show 'bout myself like I'm Chelsea Handler
Or write a series 'bout my bitches like I'm Kelsey Grammar
Nicknamed the jet Jayhawk 'cause it's outta Kansas
You know it's Spaldin' in my top, I'm in my esperanza
You know it's slammin' wall to wall
We gotta fill the stands up, with slaps and the anthems
Poetic justice, I got you in all my stanzas
With your model stances, you everything I know about it
What we know
Where you shall go
Power, ah
Uh, yeah
C-notes, B-notes, I took the biggest boat
We stayed down for life, it's like a jingle to do 'em all
We too much involved to spend a single ounce of time
She bust a whole ounce by doin' lines
I had to leave, like the leaves do trees
I'm finally home, I wiped the stress, then I touched that sweat
We took 'em 35 to 1 like this shit roulette
Hold up, beg your pardon, we done lit up, baby
Set up, told the preacher, "Never finish", that's to say the least
Buy it, never lease it, but I gotta lease it
Mobile, Mona type of pieces, Met Gala, night Jesus
Skip it, hit the city, party pack, I got it with me
I'm shotty while I let you with me
I'm too bent to let you ride, barely 'til it's empty
Gotta feel me, pockets dumb fat and I got a skinny
Squad is with me, and that's everything I know about it
Mother Earth is pregnant for the third time
For y'all have knocked her up
I have tasted the maggots in the mind of the universe
I was not offended
For I knew I had to rise above it all
Or drown in my own shit

I won't doubt it, I won't
He won't mislead all His followers
Prayin' on the process, minus Spirit
Feel like
Like I'm
Floatin' in my prime time
One life, live it, right now
One life, live it, yeah
Goodbyes, that's life
Fun times, for life
For life, from down my eyes
Thank God I'm free tonight
Got God on the line
Tell the devil I'm fine
He always tryin'
Tryin' his best (no question)
Top of the pole, me and my bros
When the story gets old
It's gon' be BMF (muchas gracias)
This shit sound hard
It wasn't made easy
You can't live twice
Thank God I'm breathin'
We gotta go now
One life, live it, right now
One life, live it, yeah
Goodbyes, that's life
Fun times, for life
For life, from down my eyes
Thank God I breathe tonight
Oh
Still no pressure
Thank God, I breathe
'Cause shit I speak is what they need, I tell no lies
I'm still up top, they still can't drop, but what if they not?
Yeah (yeah)
Last tape was filled up with slaps, I guess gotta run this shit back
Didn't like the way that shit went down at the awards, I admit it, turned to a beast
This that shit right here that get me goin', after I pop me a piece
Way that we killin' the critics and killin' the hate, might gotta talk to a priest
The way we evolved and knocked down walls, this shit's outrageous
A quarterback calls, I don't like 12, except Tom Brady
Can't short my stock, I still stack tall, you still can't trade me
Storm's a minor but you know she livin' major (that's right, daddy)
When you flyin' up this high, it ain't no cables
Shit so lit, what happen in Vegas, it stay in Vegas
Mornin' time, we check the news, we made the papers

Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, turn it up, my headphones
To the maker, vibrator
Roof shaker, earthquaker
Annihilator
Yeah
Baby, please get off the 'Gram
I like you better in the stands
I upgrade my only fan
It do or don't need a cam'
This right here my new modern jam
I'm on fire, the new burnin' man
She paid to view, that's an on-demand
Hey, Guy-Man, brought him home from France
This shit punk, put it on the Bible
I like a bi girl on a bi-cycle
Then I bought a car, now she feel entitled
My dick so hard, pokin' likе the Eiffel
I just need the world, I ain't hard to plеase
Way I keep the knowledge, think I'm Socrates
I got 'em levitatin' way off their knees
The way I make it jump, I make it hard to breathe, it's like
Bright, tight
The annihilator, forever favor
True upgrader, you a shaker
Car breaker
Baby, don't you know I got to go?
Got the glow and it got to show
Know it's been a year since I seen the road
Had me inside like I'm on parole
I'm outside like I'm on patrol
I hear the zeitgeist, now I'm in the zone
You know they say you up when you finally free
It won't feel right if it's only me
If you're scared, nigga, say your grace
I got the formula like I own the race
I got the keys with me like I own the place
If these niggas on top, then I'm outta space
I'd rather spend it on you than on Uncle Sam
Give this shit my all, but don't give a damn
Even in the winter, it's a summer jam
I told her buckle up 'cause it's goin' down, it's like
Bright
Truth breaker, heartthrob, baby
Feather skater, you true raider
Daka-doo-doo-da-da
Uh-uh, I know you're lyin'
Outside waitin' in the line
Gettin' dough one at a time (oh)
Uh-uh, I know you're lyin'
Outside waitin' in the line
Gettin' dough one at a time (oh)
Bounce, baby, I'm in the buildin', baby
Do it, baby, you got my consent, baby
Oh, this the remix, oh, this the remix
Before she let me in, she gotta pat me down
Before she let me in, she gotta pat me down
The annihilator
Forever favor

When I stare in your eyes
You'll be there forever
To watch our life (to watch our life together)
You just like going to Heaven (my heart)
Oh, where are you taking me? (oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah)
I'm fallin', and, I'm drownin'
But, you're takin' me
One thousand on my feet
Stacks spreaded on my seat
Ten thousand on my eyes (eyes)
Rollie Pollie on my wrist
Gotta make a flight, big day, slummin' on FaceTime
Fifty K, wonderin' why I'm stormin' off, no race
Emboldened by the bliss
I was sworn in by a kiss
Late from the country caters
No peacemaker, I sweep up cases
Goin' on a walk with a new suit armor
New suit dead, Bottega, that's on it
Give me the heat from the sleep, then I harm her
Cupid creep in, sleep with a Hummer
Three time to get me T-T-T'd
Still same phone, AT&T-T
Still givin' news very vividly
Beef in there, fuck a beef
Smokin' on some vicious type of reefer
I need no beef, no cheese (yeah)
Even when I eat, they cheat (yeah)
Every time we meet, naive
When I stare in your eyes
You'll be there forever
To watch our life (to watch out life together)
You just like going to Heav- (my heart)
One thousand on my feet
Stacks spreaded on my seat
Ten thousand on my eyes (eyes)
Yeah, it's mad how it gets so deep
It's mad how I get so high
It's mad how you get me by (by)
Look in my eyes, tell me a tale
Do you see the road, the map to my soul?
Look, tell me the signs whenever the smoke clear out of my face
Am I picture-perfect, or do I look fried?
All of that green and yellow, that drip from your eyes is tellin'
Tell you demise, I went to my side
To push back the ceilin' and push back the feelings, I had to decide
I replay them nights, and right by my side, all I see is a sea of people that ride wit' me
If they just knew what Scotty would do to jump off the stage and save him a child
The things I created became the most weighted, I gotta find balance and keep me inspired (hah)
Yeah, yeah
That shit wild, instead I'm a hero
I took it from zero, LaFlame Usain
I run it from miles, this shit wasn't luck
They got me fucked up, I put you on bus and take you around
A couple of guys inside of the school, I gave 'em the tools to get it off ground
They say they the ones when they make the errors
Can't look in the mirror, that shit wild
Stand on the stage, I give 'em the rage
No turnin' it down, can't tame it, can't follow it
We do it for streets, we do it for keeps, we do it for rights, got 52 weeks
This shit ain't for pleasure, I'm comin' to tweak
This shit is forever and infinity
Number eight, yeah, we write it and wrap it around
I take me beat and I turn to a beast
Bought the crib on a hill, made it harder to reach
Bought a couple more whips 'cause I needed more speed
Bought a couple more watches, I needed more time
Didn't buy the condo, it was smarter to lease
And I bought some more ice 'cause I brought in the heat
Made a cast of my dick, so she never gon' cheat
If I gave you a day in my life or a day in my eyes, don't blink

La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la (watchin' in)
La, la, la, la
Only one they watchin' in (la, la, la, la) yeah
La, la, la, la
It ain't up to you no more
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
God Country, this is war
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Wakin' up, I see the light
I been drunk and it's alright
I took the drive to clear my mental
Would tint the whip but it's a bike
It's demon time, I got it on me (on me)
Might earn a teardrop overnight
Wear Louis shades to block my psyche (psyche)
It's hot as hell, we'll wear the ice
You in God's Country, not in Montgomery
Go Ted Bundy, then go home and play Al Bundy
The card black and you know it got a sky limit
I make a mill' every-, you decide, choice is yours
The butterfly reflect the doors
I hit the gas and metamorph
Couldn't get this shit off credit score
Hunnid thousand, pack the fans
Got 'em jumpin' with no hands (hands)
Need more spaces where we jam (jam)
In God's Country with the fam
Yeah, whoa
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

Every night, I look up in the sky
And the stars are all there
But when I look for you, you're never there
Explorer, are you out there? There, there, there
We had to spread out the word (mm)
I was too damn determined, rap game, it needed refurbish
I was on top with no service, watch as they all playin' verses
They in the bushes, they lurkin', might gotta call the insurgence
She wanna fuck with a purpose, I gotta juggle my urges
Got a couple departments, closet built like a department
Double up cup of the Bourbon how I give all of my sermons
Yeah, we still (still) do things down to detail
Diva and the Devil, both them bad as He-ell
They get quiet when he yell (he yell)
Can't silent my people
You locked in the prequel, meet me at the festie-viel ('viel)
Festie-vial ('vial)
(Foo, foo, foo, foo, foo, foo, foo, foo)
Now I got your attention (look out), it's wide and beatin' (look out)
Vile this evenin' (look out), you never leavin' (look-look-look-look-look-look)
Clock out, we sneak in (look-look-look-look-look)
All the demons need a reason (o-o-o-out)
Up from 2 AM to two in the afternoon (look out)
It's a festival right in my room (look out)
Soon as the sun up, you know that we doom (look out)
Mariposa, we out to Cancun (look out)
We gon' hustle more just before we out the room (look out)
Back outside, it ain't no time for Zooms (look out)
One point two, that's a whole lot of more "Vroom" (look out)
Three point two, that's a whole lot of whole lotta (look out)
It's live, remember days that I couldn't get by
Not outside, they come with it inside
Now your venue, we gotta resize
I can't give all this credit to Colgate
By the way I be rentin' the smile (look out, look out)
I know sometimes I be in denial (look out, look out)
I know sometimes I be in the wild (look out, look out)
How I rockin' the, rockin' the-, ah

Drivin' reckless through a storm and
'Cause you a breakfast in the mornin'
My nights is abnormal, advice ain't informal
I didn't try to warn before they went and swarmed you
The height we made is paranormal
We shake and wake up to paranoia
Won't let it destroy you, won't let it annoy you
I'm tryna enjoy you in front of the foyer
We can't seem to break through out the logical (ah)
To see it in the day, you gotta free your soul (I'm breakin' through the echoes)
You wanna reign supreme and never let them go

Unnaturally breathin'
Like a waist that is snatchin'
Welcome to my world where it's packed in
At the top of the tavern
How I see when this happenin'
All the real have been dabbed in
All the, all the bumps and the grabbin'
Ain't no cops here harassin'
All the looks and the laughin'
And outside, it got traffic
'Cause inside, we wreak havoc
Yeah, I know when this
Yeah, I know when this drastic, where it's goin'
When I back up emotions
All this here, I'm controllin'
When I'm back in the
When I'm back in the streets, on my side, I'm patrollin'
When I'm back in the, when I'm back in the (ah)

Too hard to go drop off
You know that boy not soft

With my palo santo
In this world, look around, yo
It's just mano y mano
I might still eat McDonald's
But don't think I'm a Ronald
I went back to my land
Move like Moses, walkin' over seas
In my state big as the country
Every part of it is part of me
Tell your parliament, "Pardon me" (woo)
Off the saké, turned to Socrates (woo)
Havin' moments on the ground
Finna shape it, in the sound

I will fight for everything I love, forever
And I will love everything that I fight for, forever

The dogs out the kennel, watchin' with the scope off
With the heat talk, watch it burn your soul off (ah)

I'm tryna feel a shade of greatness by celebratin'
Bring entertainment, goin' brainless, like goin' dumb on my hiatus
She fall more in love every time that I tip
I fade away every time that I-
Take a sip, I been goin' off the rip
I been bumpin' more Coldplay, the world cold as shit
I know one thing 'bout the old one, can't have more fun with it
Knew exactly how to roll one and how to tote a stick
Even if she at the shows, show she never let 'em hit
Always knew she always on one and I can bear with it
Yeah, I can bear with it
Where will you go now?
Now that you're done with me
Where will you go now?
Now that you're done with me
Where will you go now?
Now that you're done with me
Where will you go now?
Now that you're done-
'Til further notice
'Til further notice
'Til further notice (we'll keep you posted)
'Til further notice (I'll keep you posted)
