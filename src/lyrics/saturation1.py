lyrics = '''
I got pipe dreams of crack rocks and stripper poles
Of fucking center folds
So I got secrets only me and all my niggas know
Of kicking in the doors
I'll send a bitch to get ya
So don't play fucking stupid
I know you got the product
'Cause I could smell the money
I could taste the weed
Give me somethin' or a body, only way I'll leave
I love to watch 'em squirm
I love when bitches bleed
If she's sucking on the barrel, you can't hear her scream
So kiss the fucking carpet
This aggravated Larson
And then I'm out the door
It's monsters in your home
Black gloves, mask on, muzzle plated chrome
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
That's the first one to go
The first shot I blow
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
Shotta, shotta
Who be that, the number one shotta?
Put a missile on you when I'm on your blocka
And you'll be thin, you'll be issue when I'm off it, off it, I'm off it
I got the magazine from the pistol
For any politician talkin' shit, givin' issue
Another black man in the street, it's official
We riding out the spirit, here go another pistol
Ha, fuck, another cracka!
Cop coming on my block for the answers
Huh? I no got time for your question
Huh, just put mi mommy and mi bredren
I hate the way I think, I hate the way it looms
I hate the way the things I say incinerate a room
I know I'm tryna change, but it'll never work
Just end up more broken down than when I started
And that concrete feels the hardest every time I seem to touch it
Started thinking I ain't meant for life but that's too deep
Falling up into the ceiling while I'm drowning in the
Creek of my emotions trying harder to be open
Talking 'bout release dates
I'm trying to make it to tomorrow
Internal honesty could be the hardest pill to swallow
So I need two shots of everything that's on the fuckin' menu
I'm dancing with myself; setting fire to the venue, motherfucker
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
That's the first one to go
The first shot I blow
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
Fuck you!
I'll break your neck so you can watch your back
Fuck you!
I'll break your neck so you can watch your back
I'll break your neck so you can watch your back
Fuck you!
I'll break your neck so you can watch your back
Fuck you
My old friend fucked my girlfriend, I should've shot him
Pray to god about him
Man, I hit the lotto
Yeah, my bitch got badder
Shit, my ass got badder
And I forgave them bitches
So now it's off to millions
I been fucking sinning
Hit the forehead, chest, left, right, I'm grinning
Asses on the ceiling
And I got mirror feelings
For all you lil' demons
Yeah, you see the chain
'Fore all you changed on me
Rearranged on me
Suck a dick about it
I hope you get offended
And this ain't clean shit
This is pissing off the yacht with my bitch on me
Wearin' mink on me
Sippin' Cris' on ya
Bet ya life on it
I came to fight for it
Came in, raided all your pockets
And your bitch came in and rubbed up on me
I'm burning rubber, I pulled up on you
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet
Boy, better treat me with respect
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet
Boy, better treat me with respect
Keep a gold chain on my neck (keep up the chain)
Fly as a jet
Boy, better treat me with respect
Keep a gold chain on my neck (keep up the chain)
Fly as a jet
Boy, better treat me with respect
Rock the boat like a one-eyed pirate
Rick James, I get glitter on my eyelids
2 A.M., eighty-five on the highway
Whole world get a little misguided
Where the spotlight? Put me in the spotlight
Trust no one that put you in the wrong light
I scream when I hit her with the long pipe
Mmm, ice cream when I hit her with the sweet thang
Do my thing, no, I do not do speaking
Get my shot, point it out like whoop, bang
I'ma win a bitch and I got a mood swing
I'm the realest, bitch, now I got a mood swing
I got bipolar confidence
Wake up like "shit" then I feel like a shit
So I guess I'm the shit
Yeah, guess I'm the shit
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet
Boy, better treat me with respect
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet
Boy, better treat me with respect
Keep a gold chain on my neck (keep up the chain)
Fly as a jet
Boy, better treat me with respect
Keep a gold chain on my neck (keep up the chain)
Fly as a jet
Boy, better treat me with respect
Grab life by the horns when I whip the Lambo
Black on red like I work the sambo
Clip's so long it'll make you mumble
Watch you tangle, dutty wine
She grind on my dick like a hundred times
Shawty love me long when I grip your sides
You slip inside like a slip and slide
My electric eel, your electric slide but
I just wanna feel up the booty
All on me, all on me, all on me
We can slow clap like wooty
All on me, all on me, all on me
I just wanna feel on your booty
Grab the camcorder, we can make it a movie
Bring a friend with you if you like how I do it
Gold chain swingin', and she like how I shoot it
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet
Boy, better treat me with respect
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet
Boy, better treat me with respect
Keep a gold chain on my neck (keep up the chain)
Fly as a jet
Boy, better treat me with respect
Keep a gold chain on my neck (keep up the chain)
Fly as a jet
Boy, better treat me with respect
Damn
Damn, I'm frosty
Blood diamond, I'm flossing
Navy camel, I'm drowning
But you don't see what it cost me
Turn 'em on like the Saudis
Hand-me-downs never fit me
Party never fit me, punani never fit me
Damn, time travelin', Honda swervin', that's so Merlyn
That's so Merlyn
That's so Merlyn
That's so Merlyn
Damn, time travelin', Honda swervin', book learnin'
That's so Merlyn
That's so Merlyn
That's so Merlyn
Swan dived on the 405
Land at the bottom of Arturo High
With the precision of a cut from a Zorro knife
The boy spit like he made out of 409
So that's clean, bitch
You can't play with my team, bitch
We rock pink, no more Wednesdays
Wringler's good with your envy
Mix with white 'cause you salty
But this stainless
I'm like platinum and it's painless
I just skip on the beat like I'm Pee-Wee Herman
Hands off of all my sermons
My wheel's turnin', now I'm more efficient than ever
I feel like Ratatouille when I'm whipping that Chevy
You see, you better fucking get some sweaters 'cause this ice
Might fuck around and change your whole life
'Cause we about to take flight
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet
Boy, better treat me with respect
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet
Boy, better treat me with respect
Keep a gold chain on my neck (keep up the chain)
Fly as a jet
Boy, better treat me with respect
Keep a gold chain on my neck (keep up the chain)
Fly as a jet
Boy, better treat me with respect
Keep a gold chain (wax, wax it)
I keep a gold chain (wax, wax it)
Keep a gold chain
(I said I keep a gold chain)
Keep a gold chain
(I keep a gold chain)
Keep a gold chain
'Cause then I keep a
(I keep a gold chain) a gold chain, keep a gold chain
(Keep a gold chain) I said I keep a, I keep a
(Keep a gold chain) (wax, wax it)
I might go Interstellar
I feel like Matthew McConaughey
I don't care for what they gotta say
Tony Perkis how I drop the weight
Jason Bourne with the headshot
Jason Statham with the whip game
Liam Neeson with the rescue
I go Gunnar with the leather face
Bruce Campbell with the chains
Tobin Bell with the saw
Anthony Hopkins, I'm eatin' 'em raw
They don't know who we are
Molly Shannon I'm a superstar
Ride or die like it's sea biscuit
Tryna stack like Tobey
John Wick, I don't leave a witness
Chris Paul, I'm assistin'
Ameer going Blake Griffin
Give me forty-eight minutes
We go '04 Pistons
Catch a fade like Robert Horry
Only time to get the spotlight
Deray how I'm top flight
Go Obama when I drop mics
I'm the black Tom Hanks
You can call me nigga Banks
Secret Agent Cody Banks
Quarter pound of the dank
On the scale and it stank
Throwin' mama in a range
I just bought a new Wraith
Nic Cage with the face off
John Travolta when I take off
Brad Pitt, start a fight club
Turn the trap into the nightclub
I'm like Prince with the white doves
Paint a picture with the white dust
Lionel Ritchie with the white bitch
Try to tell it to her nicely, but she never wanna listen
Beat the pussy to submission
Tom Cruise on a mission
Pull a RnB singer, bring her back to South Central
I shine just like a popstar, MJ my initial
Kobe Bryant with the spin moves
If these niggas got issues, H-town with Beyonce
Turn her to my prom date
King pin like Jay Z, dance moves like J.T
Heath Ledger with some dreads
I just gave my nigga head
Standing on my two legs
Fuck what that nigga done said
Bruh, I don't fuck with no white boys
Less the nigga Shawn Mendes
I been off and I been dead
Bad as hell, I don't bench press
High school, they ain't fuck with me
Now the critics don't fuck with me
My own fam ain't fuck with me
But Viceland did fuck with me
I'm the only popstar with no money
Can't drive, so I'm still running
Uber takin' all my show money
But that's okay, I got more money
Not enough to get my teeth fixed
So my boyfriend in the street, bitch
In the moonlight I get seasick
Did ya see all that, all that we did?
Did all this shit in the weekend
We was up all late tweakin' (yeah!)
Ice Cube on a Friday, Chris Tucker on a Friday
Michael Cera on a Friday, Jonah Hill on a Friday
Rockin' leaves, blood diamonds
Sucked off on the highway
Police right behind me
Like a nigga stole his OJ
Okay, I don't play
Got the same last name as O.J
Hella boys say, hella boys say, hella boys
I feel just like Zayn
I feel just like Harry
I cop it and I flip it
Have it sittin' on pirellis
Me and all my niggas
South side, One Direction
Tens and tens and tens and tens
Got lens that make direction
Flow to my location
Lowkey I'm in Cali just avoiding my probation
Fuck your jurisdiction, fuck the federales
Sold out by my father, he gon' feel the karma
When I get the, get the commas, nigga
I don't have, I don't have no fear, nigga
Buy the ounce, sellin' ounces over here, nigga
I don't lie, I just bought a whole grill
Arguing with my bitch, my whip sit twenty-six nigga
Lowkey I'm a heartthrob
And I ain't drop an album yet
I'm something like a poster
Sitting on your girl's wall
And something about my face
Make her take her clothes off
Ya'll say I got bitches
But y'all bitches make my dick soft
Why y'all always mad cause I'm feeling myself
What the fuck you mean?
I can't feel myself?
Old girl suburban
But now I'm on to new things
Ego like celebrity, but real like a dope fiend
Tanning out in Hollywood, got Chantel's on my coattails
From motels to hotels, I'm good
Bitch I'm good, from hotels to motels, I'm good
Bitch I'm good, from hotels to motels, I'm good
Bitch I'm good
Hella boys say, hella boys say, hella boys
They say that they want me, they forgot about me
They say that they want me, they forgot about me
They say that they want me, they forgot about me
They say that they want me, they forgot about me
In the city I'm a menace
I give C.E.O's the business
Marathons I gotta finish
Foreign whip is speaking Yiddish
Lately I been feeling vicious
Why y'all crying like some infants
You don't wanna be a witness
Then you better mind your fucking business
All these crumbs on my denim
We the only dogs spitting venom
Been some years I tried to tell them
But they wanted me to be the villain
They just wanted me to lose
Ones I love, made me choose
Had to cut the ones I thought I'd take to the top
Just so I could make a move
Dropped out of college
Smoking the same campus
Tell me 'bout limits
Last year I was suicidal
Took those thoughts and tried to kill it
Used to avoid, used to being paranoid
Huffin with my boys
Pack it up, I shake the world like asteroids
Give me love before you try to give me noise
I destroy
Hella boys say, hella boys say, hella boys
They say that they want me they forgot about me
I got some demons on me
They been feeding on me
When I sold prescriptions
And my pill addiction
Fuck the damn detectives
Mama called the Reverend
I know she praying for me
But I'm in the shadows
Hella drugs and ammo
Kicking doors my MO
I got some bad habits
I do some shit I shouldn't
My life is on a scale
I know there's angels on me
All my dead homies
I know they waiting on me
Selling dope from mansion house
I know you praying for me
I know you used to trust me
I miss the chicken nuggets
And the kisses from her
Damn I miss you momma
Trouble keep following me
Shadow keep following me
Trouble keep following me
Shadow keep following me
Shadow keep following me
Trouble keep following me
Yippy Yay Yippy Yay
Hit me on my cellular phone

I just need to be alone
Nigga talk shit?
I'll single you out
If you've got a problem we can figure it out
I'm from H-Town, but the gold in my mouth
South-side niggas put a hole in your house
A hole in your spouse
Better think twice before you open you mouth
It's getting real close to the first of the month
Niggas hit licks, bit of gas in the blunt
Send em to the dock gotta open them up
Niggas load guns in the back of the truck
Niggas chase money 'til they laced with gold
Gotta get a gun for your hateful foes
Flex too hard and your casket close
You don't want your momma come and get you from the morgue
Tall white T, blood on the floor
Oh, don't say that
Yippy Yay Yippy Yay
Hit me on my cellular phone
Yippy Yay Yippy Yay
I'll be right back with the dope
Yippy Yay Yippy Yay
I know you niggas need some more

Yippy Yay Yippy Yay
I know you niggas need some more
Take that shit from me some more
I just need to be alone
I feel like Master P
I ain't gonna say they lame, no one try to master me
I'm getting tested, tested, but nobody passing me
That sugar coated shit don't need them extra calories
Ace in the machine, that's why we work inside the factory
Pull up my phone display, like it's a gallery
Go and get your salary
Gold on me like it's alchemy
Gave them niggas the battery
When they witness the mastery
Don't say that, don't talk to me, we don't play that
They got shot for me, and they idolize, like it's pottery
Got a squad full of fucking oddities, I got squash, apricots, and broccoli
We turn weird shit to a commodity
I'm on a odyssey for real quality
Yippy Yay Yippy Yay
Hit me on my cellular phone
Yippy Yay Yippy Yay
I'll be right back with the dope
Yippy Yay Yippy Yay
I know you niggas need some more
Take that shit from me some more

Hit me on my cellular phone
Yippy Yay Yippy Yay
I'll be right back with the dope
Yippy Yay Yippy Yay
I know you niggas need some more
Take that shit from me some more
I just need to be alone
I look like a Somali pirate (don't say that!)
Failed middle school and college (don't say that!)
Daddy say I'm an asshole (don't say that!)
Dick complexion of a Backwoods (ew, don't say that)
She take me, dry as the Sahara
After she get in that Casa Merlyn
I was in that mouth like flouride
That pussy tight, as a hair tie
Scrunchie, I'm so horny baby, bitch your house, pussy baby
When I get the munchies I still, I don't share roaches baby
Rolling with the good haircut Bum with a good haircut
Mattress and magic dick
Yippy Yay Yippy Yay
Hit me on my cellular phone
Yippy Yay Yippy Yay
I'll be right back with the dope
Yippy Yay Yippy Yay
I know you niggas need some more
Take that shit from me some more

I'll be right back with the dope
Yippy Yay Yippy Yay
I know you niggas need some more
Take that shit from me some more
I just need to be alone
Still the only one I do that with
Still the only one I do that with
Ain't that some shit
Still the only one I do that with
Still the only one I do that with
Ain't that some shit
See I've been trippin' and fallin'
No more slippin' and stallin'
Got no numbers I'm callin, just wanna be in the coffin
All this trouble we've been causin'
Benz I'm crossing, I've been saucin'
Exercising my endorphin's since you told me you was walkin'
I've been searchin, huntin, crawlin
Whats it costin me it ain't doing much, saucin me through a loop
I hush the voices in my head for a minute so I can listen to you
And all I ever heard was "I ain't listenin", shit is cripplin'
Still the only one I do that with
Still the only one I do that with
Ain't that some shit
Still the only one I do that with
Still the only one I do that with
Ain't that some shit
Niggas on that word of mouth, 'til they see them boys come out
I ain't ever robbed a nigga, best believe I air ya out
See me in your area, ya'll niggas hilarious
I'm addicted to writing shit that make niggas scared of us
Niggas on that word of mouth, 'til they see them boys come out
I ain't ever robbed a nigga, best believe I air ya out
See me in your area, ya'll niggas hilarious

Niggas on that word of mouth, 'til they see them boys come out
I ain't ever robbed a nigga, best believe I air ya out
See me in your area, ya'll niggas hilarious
I'm addicted to writing shit that make niggas scared of us
I got rubbers in my pocket, niggas like to gossip
If I need to drop em let me know
'Cos I don't do much talkin', unless it's 'bout the money
If you got an offer let me know
I was sellin' cabbage, until I moved to Cali
Money in a mattress on the floor
Until I messed with niggas, with fingers on the trigger
We was runnin' kickin' in the doors
Niggas on that word of mouth, said they see them boys come out
I ain't ever robbed a nigga, best believe I air ya out
See me in your area, ya'll niggas hilarious
I'm addicted to writing shit that make niggas scared of us
I use protection, my nigga, so fuck direction, my nigga
And fuck yo section, my nigga, I got the rest of my niggas
My niggas rushed on my niggas, my niggas love all they niggas
I fell in love with a nigga, that nigga skipped out the picture
Today I'mma be whoever I wanna be
Today I'mma be whoever I wanna be
It's a boy fantasy
It's a girl fantasy
This is our fantasy
Baby boy, boy, boy
Today I'mma be whoever I wanna be
Today I'mma be whoever I wanna be
It's a boy fantasy
It's a girl fantasy
This is our fantasy
Baby boy, boy, boy
Flap, flap, flap your wings
Go high, go high, go high
Ride, ride, ride, ride, rider on the night
Slow down, I wanna say goodbye
To everybody here 'cause they're all the same
I hate this place
Everybody here is all the same
Life's a disgrace
Today I'mma be whoever I wanna be
Today I'mma be whoever I wanna be
It's a boy fantasy
It's a girl fantasy
This is our fantasy
Baby boy, boy, boy
Today I'mma be whoever I wanna be
Today I'mma be whoever I wanna be
It's a boy fantasy
It's a girl fantasy
This is our fantasy
Baby boy, boy, boy
Flying on my rocket ship
I'm on an acid trip
I need another pill
Snorted lady drip
I'm with my white friends
We're getting wasted
Trapped in the suburbs
We suffocatin'
We get all our drug and medication
You came with black folks
Hoe, your parents racist
You say they hate me
Well I love them
We still roll up, we still best friends
Everybody smilin'
I don't see what's funny
Everybody friends
Guess I wasn't lucky
Family full of athletes
I was kind of chubby
Shit was never sunny
Wrists were sorta bloody
Lick my wounds, while me
Save me for the vultures
I'm fallin' in the void
I don't know what I discovered
I know I could hear the thunder
I can feel the hunters
They be praying on my hunger
I won't let 'em make me suffer
Today I'mma be whoever I wanna be
Today I'mma be whoever I wanna be
It's a boy fantasy
It's a girl fantasy
This is our fantasy
Baby boy, boy, boy
Today I'mma be whoever I wanna be
Today I'mma be whoever I wanna be
It's a boy fantasy
It's a girl fantasy
This is our fantasy
Baby boy, boy, boy
Ooh, take a moment
To you, take a moment
To you, take a moment
Ooh, take a moment
To you, take a moment
To you, take a moment
We failed at a one night stand
I guess that should not matter
You were loved, by another man
I guess that should not matter
You love to show out
Show your, new outfit
You love to show out
When you leave the house
Your new outfit
I love it on you
I love it on you though, I love it on ya
I came to California
I cannot afford this
I just want a fortune
I don't want to pay my mortgage
I just want life for my kids
Damn, I ain't even have em yet
I'm ballin' and it don't stop
And it don't stop
I can see my life through the window glass
If I move with you I don't need no cash
Had a dream last night that she loved me back
He got in my head so a nigga bounced back
Shit happened how it happened
So the past is perfect
Shit happened how it happened
So the past is perfect
Shit happened how it happened
So the past is perfect
Shit happened how it happened
Fell in love but it ain't gon' last
Hydroplane like I ain't gon' crash
No frame with my face on glass
No rain when they check my class
Got a minute, got a second, got a day
Gotta get it, gotta find another way
I ain't trippin', I'm just feelin' what I say
I ain't talking, I'm just spillin' from my brain
Everybody think I got it figured out
Chasin' sanity while niggas chasin' clout
Show me love in the face of all doubts
That would tell me all I need to know about you
Ain't nobody gon' love you like me
Ain't nobody gon' trust you like me
Baby girl I know we can save the world
So why you wanna fight me?
You love to show out
Show your, new outfit
I love it on you though, I love it on ya
Sucking on my pinky ring, smelling like chrysanthemum
I just want that, I just want that bump, bump in my trunk
Blowing skunk, getting crunk with my baby, oh what's up
Bump, bump in my trunk, bump, bump in my trunk
We gon' ride ride ride, down to Mexico
You can see the bad man, I caught him, you can't catch him though
You can see the bad man, I caught him, you can't catch him though
White lies all the way to Mexico
Merlin! Merlin!
When this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live
When this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live
I've been trappin' out my momma house
Dope boy money, keep the water and the lights on
Spray it like it's Lysol
Your bitch don't like the dark so we fuckin' with the lights on
I fuck her with my chains on, you the one I changed on
I just won the ghetto lottery, I guess I'm hood rich
Chillin' at the gallows smokin' blacks with my hood bitch
You ain't what you could be, come get on this dope dick
I sell it by the gram now, tell me who you fuck with
When this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live
When this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live
Watch me, watch me, watch me, watch me operate
I ain't ain't here to talk now nigga we ain't gonna conversate
This modern terrorism, you can't moderate
I've been fiendin', time to put these demons on display
'Cause they don't understand, and I don't give a damn
Smoke some shit straight outta Alice in Wonderland
Brockhampton the clan, bitch I ain't your man
Like they're stacking just to crumble like an avalanche
This is how it stand, this is how it is
Bitch I ain't your friend, I ain't havin' kids
'Cause I know that if I'm gon' bring 'em in the world
My little spawns of Satan might just take off with your fucking girl
Bump bump in my trunk
Bump bump bump bump bump bump in my trunk
Bump bump in my trunk
Bump bump in my trunk
Bump bump bump bump bump bump in my trunk
Bump bump in my trunk
When this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live
When this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live
When this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live
When this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live

Big money, big bands, simple bands
Get money, big bands, simple bands
Big money, big bands, simple bands
Get money, big bands, simple bands

Rollin' in my truck, gotta keep it tucked
Because whitey wanna fuck with some niggas like us
Confederate flag, neighbors call me fag
Gotta keep it low, I keep that thang up in my bag
Whose society is this?
Who delayed my first kiss?
Who command my scholarship?
And kick us out our neighborhood?
Play our music make them rich
Play our music make amends
Box us in like plantains
Free all of my Africans
Nigga I slay, nigga I waste them them, waste them
There go that danger boy, that danger boy!
Niggas kill you for a dollar
Listen to them holler
Big blood ballers, with a crown on my corner
Crack and marijuana, slab around the corner
Sitting low elbows, syrup on the dashboard
Get money, big bands, simple bands
Big money, big bands, simple bands
Get money, big bands, simple bands
Big money, big bands, simple bands

I got a dream I'm willing to die for
I got a team I'll commit a crime for
Got some dead homies I ain't get to cry for
'Cuz I'm working for my freedom, while the world cry war
Cry wolf when the shepherd finds a way to strike gold
'Cuz the stocks gon' crash and the dollar gon' fold
You don't know that the poor eat the rich when there's no profit
They gave you the floor, but you brought up the wrong topic
So it's
Me against the world
I ain't the same nigga that I once was
I lost my fucking mind and then I fell in love
I did a bunch of drugs because I couldn't sleep
I lost a couple months, I chipped my fucking teeth
And there's a couple women, and they know some things
About lies that I done told and shit that I done said
And niggas that I robbed, so I'm real paranoid
I have voices in my head
Hi, my name is Merlyn
I just applied for food stamps
I just moved to California, with my boy band
Dropped out of a good school
Hippies in my commune
I left 'fore the rent was due
Used to want a briefcase
And a short commute
Used to wanna sell coke
And whip an Audi Coupe, crazy if I did that
Wouldn't be talking to you
Walking through the pit falls
Of a college student
Crazy how you get them letters
And they make you feel accepted 'til you
Walking 'round the campus and
You the only African
Nobody would pass 'em, just cats that take directions well
Take acid trips to find themselves
Well
I gotta get better at being me
(Being who I am)
I gotta get better at everything
(Being who I am)
I just want a friend that I can hang out with
(Being who I am)
Someone I can sit around, lay on my couch with
(Being who I am)
Ever since I moved out I've been broke
Ever since I grew up I've been ugly
Ooh, and it get me some dollar
Dollar, dollar bills y'all
Ever since I left my momma house I've been mad as hell at the world
Sometimes you don't gotta rhyme when you feel it
Sometimes I barely ever feel a fucking thing
Sometimes I wish that my fucking phone would fucking ring
And go off, and wake a nigga up
I'm used to being sad
And I'm used to being down
I'm used to being used
I miss my boy being around
I gotta get better at being me
(Being who I am)
I gotta get better at everything
(Being who I am)
I just want a friend that I can hang out with
(Being who I am)
Someone I can sit around, lay on my couch with
(Being who I am)
Droppin' all I got on this one day
I just wanna be somebody someday
Droppin' all I got on this one way
I just wanna be somebody someday
Droppin' all I got on this one day
I just wanna be somebody someday
Droppin' all I got on this one way
I just wanna be somebody someday
I gotta get better at being me
(Being who I am)
I gotta get better at everything
(Being who I am)
I just want a friend that I can hang out with
(Being who I am)
Someone I can sit around, lay on my couch with
(Being who I am)
I'm trying to look for motivation of smaller things
But baby steps to my atonement when I foster dreams
I've been told I'm too transparent with my thoughts sometimes
So I wrote songs until they pass, and I can fall in line
I fell apart the moment that you thought you found yourself
'Cause I knew at that point I couldn't be in the equation anymore
But moving on with open, broken hearts
Will show you everything you need to see about yourself to start moving forward
So many things I wanna say that I'm not sure need to be known
But everybody swears they fucking know me
So why don't I lay every card I'm holding on the table
At that point, I wonder what they'd show me
I almost lost my father
Still surreal for me to think about
Considering how many of my friends have lost theirs
I never know if what I'm saying is the right thing
If not, I'm ready more than ever for the crosshairs
It's all fair when it's not you
Some people have angels
What if only shadows follow you?
And all the ghosts inside that seem to hollow you
The branches of the weeping willow start to swallow you
And then you realize you're exactly where you're supposed to be
The horizon clears
You wipe the tears
And all the skeletons are ready for your story
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna love ya
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna hold ya
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna love ya
Just wanna hold ya
Never would lie to you
Tell me what you're waiting for
What you waiting for?
It feels like I can see the past in your eyes
I know the future has been passing you by
These other niggas, they just passing your time
They don't know how to ride the tidal waves that crash in your thighs
But I got the dream, and if you believe, then I can take you somewhere that is pristine
I'm keeping it clean, my title is mean, they boxed in a Simba, we broke out the seams
Don't make me a fiend, I know what I want, I'm working to get everything that I need
But I got a plan for ya, I'm taking a stand for ya, I care for ya
What's your motive with me baby
'Cause I don't trust nobody lately
I twist and turn, moving just like a serpent
New times are coming just like a virgin
Get you all outta my head
Cause lately I'm better off dead
I say this all out of respect
Sometimes I want nothing with you
Wearing your love like medallions
Cause I know thousand men want ya
Wants the menages
Fucking riding shotgun, slap your buns
Melting, fading, under stars and the sun
85, 90, gon' bust out the gun
Know they sent me from the neck of the woods
Change my name, state so they never could
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna love ya
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna hold ya
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna love ya
Just wanna hold ya
Never would lie to you
Tell me what you're waiting for
What you waiting for?
I need a friend (I need a friend)
And you need a home (you need a home)
I love when you come (I love when you come)
I still feel alone
You make it warm in my bed
Butterflies in my head
Sun rise and it set
But you don't love me like you say you do
White lies hold the hidden truth
You keep leaving when I need you most
It's true what they say about love had and love lost
Here you are and now you're gone
I'm left alone in the same bed
I wake up in a cold sweat
Please don't make me wait long
I just wanna be your main boy, your main, your main one
See, I don't want nobody but you
See, I don't want nobody but you
I spent the day by my lonesome
Who do you call when there's no one?
No one ever did what you did for me and to me
My bed is cold and indented where you used to sleep
Tell me what you're waiting for, shit
Tell me what I'm here for
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna love ya
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna hold ya
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna love ya
Just wanna hold ya
Never would lie to you
Tell me what you're waiting for
What you waiting for?
Was I more than it's worth or without?
You see my name and I'm faded
Fetch my copy of time
Sat by the fire, behind your eyes
And I look through them just once or twice
But I might see something I don't like
Like your continous shirt
Entwined and caught in this lovin' swirl
Losing my way
Seeing your name
But I'll be fine yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Losing my way
Seeing your name
But I'll be fine yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh
Ooh
