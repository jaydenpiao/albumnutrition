I can still feel the love
I can still feel the love
I can still feel the love
Feel the love
We not worried 'bout no other niggas, we them other niggas
You bust down a Rollie, I bust down a brick
Then I flood it, nigga
I am not to be compared to you rappers, Eazy-Duz-It, nigga
I am more Eazy, you tryin' your best to become me, nigga
She like them bottles with bubbles in it
Buy her Loewe and other linen
Why would I wait when there's other women?
Why would I hate? We in love with winnin' (ooh)
Buy her bundles, fly her out
Bring her friend, I try her out
Ain't no worries findin' out
The details is ironed out
Easily they plays along
Hopin' that I play a song
Love to fuck to trap music (feel the love)
Grrrat-gat-gat-gat-gat
Dope money just came along (woo)
Grrrat-gat (I can still feel the love)
Gat-gat-gat-gat-gat
Grrrat-gat-gat-gat (I can still feel the love)
Grrrat-gat-gat-gat-gat-gat (feel the love)
Grrrat
Ba-ba-ba-ba

Ga-ga-ga-ga
Brrr-ah-da-da, brrr-ah-da-da
Brrr-ah-da-da-da, brrr-ah-da-da-da
Brrr-ah-brrr-ah, brrr-ah-ga-grrrat
Ru-ru-ru-ru-oh!
Where the chorus?
I can still feel the love
I can still feel the love
I can still feel the love
Feel the love
Woo!
I can still feel the love
I can still feel the love
I can still feel the love
I can still feel the love

Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba (feel the love)
Ba-ba-ba-ba
Ru-ru-ru-ru-ohh!
I love all your shit talkin'
I love all your shit talkin'
You ain't got nothin' better to do with yourself
I done proved to myself, back on that rulin' myself
I got new news to tell
Act like you knew you done failed
Only true know how I feel
And only if you knew how I felt
Sniffed a lil' booch off the nail
Through with mixed-messages, through with the mail
Only a few in the field
Little bit off for the real
It's so many days I prayed to God
All this pain I couldn't seem to find a way
On a mission livin', carry on
Got my family, I'm seein' through by the days
Never late, pull up a seat and come grab a plate
Check the date, let 'em hate
This the type shit that they couldn't make
Watch the fakes
Leave 'em buzzin', thought they wasn't, huh?
Tell all your kinfolk and cousins, huh?
This is the package you ordered, huh?
Beautiful madness
On this road I find
These scars I left behind
Heaven lift me up
Heaven lift me up
On this road I find
These scars I left behind
Heaven lift me up
Heaven lift me up
[Intro: Louis Prima]
Down the chimney, he will come
With his great big smile
And you'll find that even the kiddies
Are swingin' in the latest style
Oh, oh, oh
What is Santa bringing us?
Oh, oh, oh
What is Santa bringing?
It feels so good, it should cost
Bought a alligator, I ain't talkin' Lacoste
Made me say, "Ugh, uh"
Like a mix of Master P and Rick Ross, uh-uh
She seem to make me always feel like a boss, uh-uh
She said I'm in the wrong hole, I said I'm lost, uh-uh
She said I'm goin' too fast, I'm exhausted
Now drop to your knees for the offerin'
This the theme song of something wrong
Might need an intervention for this new dimension
That's too new to mention, or fit in a sentence
If I get locked up, I won't finish the sentâ€”
Oh, oh, oh
What is Santa bringing?
Oh, oh, oh
What is Santa bringing?
Gettin' loose while I'm rollin' through, see me roll out
Watch you surf, hit the coast, and this feelin', I got
Plenty of ventures for the evenin', we go journey, we off
From the light to guide us home, we in the moment, oh-oh
Such a lost boy, caught up in the darkest I had
What's the cost, boy? Losin' everything that I had
She been on me, boy, 'less you got somethin' to tell
Sittin', waitin' for me slippin', yeah, I'll see you in hell
Tell the cougar get up off me, no, my soul ain't for sale
All the evils in the world, they keepin' on me for real
I really hope the Lord heard me, we all live in sin
Kids See Ghosts off the ropes, Ric Flair on your bitch
Now this the theme song, this the theme song
The put the beams on, get your, get your dream on
But you don't hear me though, drama: we let it go
Watch the guitars roll, but let your friends know
Oh, oh, oh
What is Santa bringing?
Oh, oh, oh
What is Santa bringing?
Just do that and then let the music do somethin', and then do that again, that'd be enough for a record
I mean, you only want two and a half minutes if you can get it, you know, three minutes max
May I say something to you to give you a true knowledge of yourself and life
Man in the full knowledge of himself is a superb and supreme creature of creation
When man becomes possessor of the knowledge of himself
He becomes the master of his environment
I don't, feel, pain anymore
Guess what, baby? I feel free
Scoop!
Nothing hurts me anymore
Guess what, baby? I feel free
I'm so complete anymore
Guess what, baby? I feel free
And you know damn well
I felt the chains on me locked in a cell
(You know I'm free, yeah) Ah!
You should quit your job to this
Hold up, that'll politic
Ooh, one day they hate you
Next day they love you
I'm still yellin', "Fuck you"
I could never trust (free)
I feel free, I feel free
I feel free
I don't feel pain anymore
Guess what, babe? I am free
Yeah, nothing hurts me anymore
Guess what, babe? I am free
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Feeling out of my past life
Died and came back twice
Now I'm free
I don't feel pain anymore
Hmm, guess what, babe? I am free
I feel free, I feel free
I feel free, I feel free
I'm so, I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
I'm so, I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Very rarely do you catch me out
Y'all done especially invited guests, me out
Y'all been tellin' jokes that's gon' stress me out
Soon as I walk in, I'm like "Let's be out"
I was off the chain, I was often drained
I was off the meds, I was called insane
What a awesome thing, engulfed in shame
I want all the rain, I want all the pain
I want all the smoke, I want all the blame
Cardio audio, let me jog your brain
Caught in the Audy Home, we was all detained
All of you Mario, it's all a game
I'm so, I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
I'm so, I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
I had my issues, ain't that much I could do
But, peace is something that starts with me, with me
At times, wonder my purpose
Easy then to feel worthless
But, peace is something that starts with me (with me, with me)
Had so much on my mind, I didn't know where to go
I've come a long way from them hauntin' me
Had me feelin' oh so low
Ain't no stoppin' you no way
All things, the night before
Ain't no stoppin' you no way
No stress yes, I'm so blessed and
I'm so, I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
I'm so, I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Movin' forward, movin' forward, movin' forward
Keep movin' forward (so long)
Keep movin' forward (I don't know why)
Keep movin' forward (so long)
Keep movin' forward (sit here in the storm)
Keep movin' forward (time goes on)
Keep movin' forward (been looking for a way out)
Keep movin' forward (from the storm)
Keep movin' forward (which way do I go?)
I'm so, I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward (which way do I go?)
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward (which way do I go?)
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward (which way do I go?)
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
I'm so, I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Ain't no stress on me Lord, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Spirit, moving around, just moving around
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts
Spirit, yeah that's the king
Stop that movement, stop that movement
Y'all can't move me, this my movie
Y'all can't stop me, ya'll too sloppy
Carbon copied, carbon
Same thing, in a room
Sittin' by myself, findin' heaven soon
Many things that will trouble you
Look beyond for a feelin' like you never knew
Reachin' out huntin' for the truth
I guessin' I'm just sick of runnin'
All this time searching hard for somethin'
I can hear the angels comin'
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Spirit, moving around, just moving around
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts
Spirit, yeah that's the king
Well it took me long enough to rap on this strong enough
Paid this shit just gon' give up
'Cause Ye just gon' live up to everything
That sucks to you and that's never enough
Thought I'd be clever enough to give up while I'm ahead
I like breakfast in bed but I love breakfast and head
For anybody who said that I was better off dead
Told 'em, "Don't ever 'lieve nothin' that you ever read"
Got a Bible by my bed, oh yes I'm very Christian
Constantly repentin' 'cause yes I never listen
Don't like bein' questioned and don't like bein' less than
Any a competition in any of my professions
So I gotta guess then, I gotta stay the best man
What else you expect from, uh, Mr. West man
Painting from Wes Lang, hung in my space like a relative
That you ain't seen in a minute, called on the telephone
And when they see you they say "Damn, you got hella grown
Always thought you'd make it but, damn, now you hella known
Let's address some topics that I can embellish on"
How we made enough bread for us to put some relish on?
I won't relish on the fact vibing on the future
Ultralight building in the building by Miuccia
Herzog and De Meuron in an office out in Basel
No not Miami, Switzerland (ahahaha)
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Spirit, moving around, just moving around
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts
Spirit, yeah that's the king
Civilization, without society
Power and wealth with nobility
Stability, without stasis
Places and spaces
Civilization, without society
Power and wealth with nobility
Stability, without stasis
Spaces and places
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts, ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Yeah that's the king
And what's a crown for the clouds, movin' around
Yeah that's the king
And what's a crown to the clouds, movin' around
Find my back
In the cold, trapped in another soul, they can hear me holler
I'm colder than the game, see 'em all strapped
And they can't move and I'm sinkin' lower
Heaven gonna help me, 'cause I feel the world weighin' on me heavy, tryna keep it steady
Ready for the mission, God shine your love on me, save me please
If I'm goin' alone, I've been gone for so long
Ain't nobody, you can't hear a word
Perched in the night, lookin' out nowhere
Where's home? I done hit a nerve
Pain in my eyes, in the time I find, I'm stronger than I ever was
Here we go again, God shine your love on me, save me please
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Stay strong
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Stay strong
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Save me, Lord
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Stay strong
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Save me, Lord
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Stay strong
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Save me, Lord
Hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah
Everybody want world peace
'Til your niece get shot in the dome-piece
Then you go and buy your own piece
Hopin' it'll help you find your own peace
Bring light to what they don't see
Auntie cryin' on the concrete
Talkin' to dispatcher when the phone beep
On the other line was the homies
Told her that you ain't comin' home, B
When she heard the news it hurt her bone-deep
Caught with the rifle with the long reach
Just another cycle of the lonely
All growin' up in environments
Where doin' crime the requirement
They send us off to prison for retirement
Hopefully Alice Johnson will inspire men
Lord shine your light on me, save me, please (hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah)
Stay strong
Lord shine your light on me, save me, please (hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah)
Stay strong
Lord shine your light on me, save me, please (hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah)
Save me, Lord
Yes, shine your light on me, save me (hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah)
Stay strong
Lord shine your light on me, save me, please (hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah)
Save me, Lord
Lord shine your light on me, save me, please (hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah)
Stay strong
Lord shine your light on me, save me, please (hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah)
Save me, Lord
Lord shine your light on me, save me, please
Lord shine your light on me, save me, please (hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah)
Stay strong
Lord shine your light on me, save me, please (hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah)
Stay strong
Both sides lose somebody
Somebody dies, somebody goes to jail
woah, woah
Stay strong
Light on me, save me please (hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah)
Stay strong
Lord, shine your light on me, save me, please (hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah)
Stay strong
Shine your light on me, save me, please (hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah)
Save me, Lord
Shine your light on me (hmm-mm-mm, woah, woah)
Stay strong
