Fake written all over you
Hate written all over you
Hate written all over
Fake written all over you
Hate written all over you
Fake written all over you
Hate written all over you
Smiling faces
Sometimes pretend to be your friend
Smiling faces show no traces
Of the evil that lurks within (Can you dig it?)
Fake written all over you
Hater written all over you
Fake written all over you, yeah

I been in the cold, couldn't feel my toes, but I still stuck to the code
Money won't fold, pockets won't hold enough
Takin' my pole in there, F&N in there
Take me anywhere, I'm takin' over the trap
I see the real clear, woodgrain Cartier
Poppin' a real pill, higher than Beverly Hills
I got too much spill, I give a bitch chills
Took out a small bill, make all the hoes strip
You need a weed feel, I get it vacuum sealed
Came from the Eastside, shooters on detail
Go purchase a new Chanel, I need a refill
Strikers in Trackhawks, ridin' the V12
I peeped the mood, dog, I peeped the intel
Get to trippin', all you gon' see is shells

You a nigga number one fan, dog
Sneak dissin', I don't understand, dog
Pillowtalkin', actin' like a fed, dog
I don't need another fake friend, dog
Can't be 'bout a ho, 'cause we sharin', dog
In you feelings, nigga, why you playin', dog?
Give her backshots, while she layin' down
Keep the Glock cocked, I don't trust hoes
Top shotter, goin' for the gusto
Like a real dog, got a mutt ho
Get the lo', you a John Doe
Bubble-eye Benz on a ho
Rappin' so pretend, you a ho
Nine-figure nigga, tag a toe
Ain't no tappin' in, better blow
Tired of poppin' pills, but he blessed
Flash a couple M's on my chest
Ain't no sabotagin', lil' finesse
We was in the field, placin' bets
Still gettin' chills in my flesh
Takin' karma, turn it to success
Thoroughbred and Pluto, nothin' less
Twenty drivers parked at the jet
Whip the Phantom to the projects
Death before dishonor, no confess

We don't trust you niggas, we don't (Smiling faces)
We don't trust you nigga, we don't (Pretend to be your friend)
We don't trust you

Can't put too much on, might catch a ice attack
Fortieth anniversary, flooded VVS
Trappin' it out the foreign, I might crash and wreck
I'm buyin' out the department, goin' to galaxy
I'm prayin' to find a plug to bring me Actavis
Bought a crib in every city, I forget my address

Got to practice what I preach, I'm buyin' my bitch baguettes

Went shoppin' out in Europe, shut down Javier
Laced in Balenci' and got Marni on my body gear
Look on Google, I been gettin' way richer еvery year

You mean, you don't trust the police?
In my business, you don't trust anybody

My chain and my rosy are presents (Yeah)
I'm havin' my way with some peasants (Yeah)
I told my jeweler, "Baguette it"
Got my bitch a lil' codeine, she rock new Celine
Made my dog a millionaire, what the fuck you mean?
She just fucked a millionaire, what the fuck you mean?
Bustin' bales down in the bath, what the fuck you mean?
I went crazy in the trap, what the fuck you mean?
My lil' brother'll rob you now, what the fuck you mean?
Drinkin' lean and poppin' tabs, what the fuck you mean?
Numero uno in the lab, what the fuck you mean?

Tie a bandana around my head, they play with 'Tro, they dead
We so icy on these meds, they so broke and scared



Oh-oh
Yeah-yeah
Young Metro, young Metro, young Metro

Where my twin at? In a courtroom
With his head up, ain't no tissue
Any issue, slang a pistol
At the opposites, smash off in a wide-body kit

Stacked a hundred bucks and it's obvious
Two mill' a show, I can geek a audience
Where the wind at, nigga?
Where the lean at, nigga?
Where the fin at, nigga?
Where my twin at?
In a courtroom, I'm on mushrooms
Renew the contract, that's a process, yeah
We ain't stoppin', we ain't boxed in
Forever locked in (Come here, yeah)
Take the Glock, gon' squeeze, don't you ask me
Getting mopped in a foreign while I'm backed in
Few thousand gon' turn up the assassins
Don't you ask me, yeah
I love Mexico, I'm always keep a decoy
Take this rapping shit global, still a D boy, huh
Smell the odor coming off, it gettin' re-rocked
Niggas tied to the mafia like Reeboks, uh
Bring the lean out, uh, bring the speed out, uh
Bring the keys out, uh, bringing Bs out, uh, bringing Cs out, uh
We just tee up, uh, we don't tee out
I can't let a bitch get close to my stash house
I done seen what niggas do to a slime boss
I get to trippin' in Jimmy Choo, I feel fine now
I get to shoot a clip, let a nigga find out
Gon' peep behind now, I could feel the vibe out
They swear they know the truth, but still, niggas ride out
I see my hitters on my live, gotta log out
I could've damaged this shit, I couldn't talk about
I'm tryna manage this shit, smoke a whole pound
Had this lil' sandman bitch sign for the penthouse
I done felt abandoned, now I know how to win now
I'ma be her friend now, no matter how it end now
