lyrics = '''
These bitches want Nikes
They looking for a check
Tell em it ain't likely
Said she need a ring like Carmelo
Must be on that white like Othello
All you want is Nikes
But the real ones just like you
Just like me
I don't play, I don't make time
But if you need dick I got you and I yam from the line
Pour up for A$AP
RIP Pimp C
RIP Trayvon, that nigga look just like me
Woo, fuckin' buzzin', woo!
That my little cousin, he got a little trade
His girl keep the scales, a little mermaid
We out by the pool, some little mermaids
Me and them gel
Like twigs with them bangs
Now that's a real mermaid
You been holding your breath
Weighted down
Punk madre, punk papa
He don't care for me
But he cares for me
And that's good enough
We don't talk much or nothin'
But when we talkin' about something
We have good discussion
I met his friends last week, feels like they're up to something
That's good for us
We'll let you guys prophesy
We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
Living so the last night feels like a past life
Speaking of the, don't know what got into people
Devil be possessin homies
Demons try to body jump
Why you think I'm in this bitch wearing a fucking Yarmulke
Acid on me like the rain
Weed crumbles in the glitter
Rain, glitter
We laid out on this wet floor
Away turf, no Astro
Mesmerized how the strobes glow
Look at all the people feet dance
I know that your nigga came with you
But he ain't with you
We only human and it's humid in these Balmains
I mean my balls sticking in my jeans
We breathin pheremones, Amber Rose
Sippin' pink-gold lemonades
Feelin'
I may be younger but I'll look after you
We're not in love, but I'll make love to you
When you're not here I'll save some for you
I'm not him but I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
You got a roommate he'll hear what we do
It's only awkward if you're fucking him too
I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
The start of nothing
I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
The start of nothing
I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good
If I could see through walls, I could see you're faking
If you could see my thoughts you would see our faces
Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
We didn't give a fuck back then
I ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids again
We'd drive to Syd's, had the X6 back then
Back then
No matter what I did
My waves wouldn't dip back then
Everything sucked back then
We were friends
I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
The start of nothing
I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
The start of nothing
I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good
In the halls of your hotel
Arm around my shoulder so I could tell
How much I meant to meant it sincere back then
We had time to kill back then
You ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids again
It's not the same, ivory's illegal
Don't you remember?
I broke your heart last week
You'll probably feel better by the weekend
Still remember, had you going crazy
Scream my name
The feeling deep down is good
I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
The start of nothing
I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
And we started from nothing
I could hate you now
It's alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good
All the things I didn't mean to say
I didn't mean to do
There were things you didn't need to say
You didn't need to need to
I could dream all night
Dream all night
I could drive all night
Drive all night
Dreaming, dream on
Yeah, yeah oh
Yeah, yeah yeah
That's the way everyday goes
Every time we have no control
If the sky is pink and white
If the ground is black and yellow
It's the same way you showed me
Nod my head, don't close my eyes
Half way on a slow move
It's the same way you showed me
If you could fly then you'd feel south
Up north's getting cold soon
The way it is, we're on land
So I'm someone to hold true
Keep you cool in this good life
Won't let you down when it's all ruined
Just the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Good Glory, dear
It's all downhill from here
In the wake of a hurricane
Dark skin of a summer shade
Nose dive in the flood lines
Tall tower, milk crate
It's the same way you showed me
Cannon ball off the porch side
Older kids trying off the roof
Just the same way you showed me (you showed)
If you could die and come back to life
Up for air from the swimming pool
You kneel down to the dry land
Kiss the Earth that birthed you
Gave you tools just to stay alive
And make it up when the sun is ruined
That's the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Where God could fear
It's all downhill from here
What a life
Remember how it was
Climb trees, Michael Jackson, all in this year
Say what up to Magic, just shoot
Say what up to Penny
Say what up to life one more time
And I know what you might want to know
Run from me and your team
Still ain't grabbin six (take it easy)
Give me somethin sweet
Bitch I might bite, ain't no tellin
This is life, life immortality
Many college students have gone to college
And gotten hooked on drugs, marijuana, and alcohol
Listen, stop trying to be somebody else
Don't try to be someone else
Be yourself and know that that's good enough
Don't try to be someone else
Don't try to be like someone else
Don't try to act like someone else, be yourself
Be secure with yourself
Rely and trust upon your own decisions
On your own beliefs
You understand the things that I've taught you
Not to drink alcohol, not to use drugs
Don't use that cocaine or marijuana because that stuff is highly addictive
When people become weed-heads they become sluggish, lazy, stupid and unconcerned
Sluggish, lazy, stupid and unconcerned
That's all marijuana does to you, okay? This is mom
Unless you're taking it under doctor's umm control
Then it's regulated. Do not smoke marijuana, do not consume alcohol
Do not get in the car with someone who is inebriated
This is mom, call me, bye
Hand me a towel, I'm dirty dancing by myself
Gone off tabs of that acid
Form me a circle, watch my Jagger
Might lose my jacket and hit a solo
One time
We too loud in public then police turned down the function
Now we outside and the timing's perfect
Forgot to tell you, gotta tell you how much I vibe with you
And we don't gotta be solo
Now stay away from highways
My eyes like them red lights
Right now I prefer yellow
Redbone, so mellow
Fuck 'round, be cutting you
Think we were better off solo
I got that act right in the Windy city that night
No trees to blow through
But blow me and I owe you
Two grams when the sun rise
Smoking good, rolling solo
Solo (solo)
Solo (solo)
S-solo (solo)
S-solo (solo)
It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Solo, solo
Solo, solo
I'm skipping showers and switching socks, sleeping good and long
Bones feeling dense as fuck, wish a nigga would cross
And catch a solo, on time
White leaf on my boxers, green leaf turn to vapors for the low
And that mean cheap, cause ain't shit free and I know it
Even love ain't, 'cause this nut cost, that clinic killed my soul
But you gotta hit the pussy raw though
Now your baby momma ain't so vicious, all she want is her picket fence
And you protest and you picket sign, but them courts won't side with you
Won't let you fly solo
I wanted that act right in Colorado that night
I brought trees to blow through, but it's just me and no you
Stayed up 'til my phone died
Smoking big, rolling solo
It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah (solo, solo)
(Solo)
By myself
(Solo)
(Solo, solo)
(Solo, solo)
This is joy, this is summer
Keep alive, stay alive
Got your metal on, we're alone
Making sweet love, takin' time
'Til God strikes us
That's a pretty fucking fast year flew by
That's a pretty long third gear in this car
Glidin' on the five
The deer run across, kill the headlights
Pretty fucking, underneath moonlight now
Pretty fucking, sunrise in sight
In comes the morning, haunting us with the beams
Solstice ain't as far as it used to be
It begins to blur, we get older (blur)
Summer's not as long as it used to be
Everyday counts like crazy (smoke, haze)
Wanna get soaked?
Wanna film a tape on the speed boat?
We smell of Californication
Strike a pose
Everything grows in the Congo, everything grows
Ooh, can you come when I call again?
On comes the evening, gold seeking ends
Piece in my hands worth twice than a friend
And two limbs over shoulder, carried away
Because I'm stronger and the Congo is dim (smoke)
In comes the morning, ah (smoke)
In comes the morning, ah (haze)
Poolside convo about your summer last night, ooh yeah
About your summer last night
Ain't give you no play, mm
Could I make you shive last night?
Could I make you shy on the last night, last night?
Could we make it in? Do we have time?
I'll be the boyfriend in your wet dreams tonight
Noses on a rail, little virgin wears the white
You cut your hair but you used to live a blonded life
Wish I was there, wish we'd grown up on the same advice
And our time was right
Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
It's no thing, it's nothing
Keep a place for me, for me
Now and then you miss it, sounds make you cry
Some nights you dance with tears in your eyes
I came to visit, 'cause you see me like a UFO
That's like never, 'cause I made you use your self-control
And you made me lose my self-control, my self-control
Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's no thing
Keep a place for me
It's no thing, it's nothing
It's no thing, it's nothing
I, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summer time
Give us, just tonight, night, night
I, I, I know you got someone comin'
You're spittin' game, know you got it
I, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summer time
Give us, just tonight, night, night
I, I, I know you got someone comin'
You're spittin' game, know you got it
Yeah
I, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summer time
Give us, just tonight, night, night
I, I, I know you got someone comin'
You're spittin' game, know you got it
It's a good guy, he hooked it up
Said if I was in NY I should look you up
I, first time I done saw you
You text nothing like you look
Here's to the gay bar you took me to
It's when I realized you talk too much, more than I do
I, it's highlights when I was convinced
That it isn't much more it's so not you
I know you don't need me right now
And to you it's just a late night out
This nigga, all the bitches in the neighborhood wanna fuck you nigga
He told me
I used to fuck with all of 'em
Yeah I ain't got bitches no more
But now I don't care about bitches like that my nigga
That shit Jasmine fucking wrecked my heart
I don't even know how to even feel about it
Round your city, round the clock
Everybody needs you
No, you can't make everybody equal
Although you got beaucoup family
You don't even got nobody bein' honest with you
Breathe 'til I evaporated
My whole body see through
Transportation, handmade
And I know it better than most people
I don't trust 'em anyways
You can't break the law with them
Get some gushy, have a calm night
Shooters killin' left and right
Workin' through your worst night
If I get my money right
You know I won't need you
And I tell you, (bitch)
I hope the sack is full up
I'm fuckin', no, I'm fucked up
Spend it when I get that
I ain't tryna keep you
Can't keep up a conversation
Can't nobody reach you
Why your eyes well up?
Did you call me from a séance?
You are from my past life
Hope you're doin' well, bruh
I been out here head first
Always like the head first
Signal comin' in and out
Hope you're doin' well, bruh
Everybody needs you
Everybody needs you
Ooh, nani nani
This feel like a quaalude
No sleep in my body
Ain't no bitch in my body
New beginning's, ah
New beginning's, wake up akh
The sun's goin' down
Time to start your day, bruh
Can't keep bein' laid off
Know you need the money if you gon' survive
The every night shit
Every day shit
Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit
That kumbaya shit
Wanna see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that na na though, could you come by?
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down and shit
Bummed out and shit, stressed out and shit
That's every day shit
Shut the fuck up, I don't want your conversation
Rollin' marijuana, that's a cheap vacation
My every day shit, every night shit, my every day shit
(Every night shit, night shit, night shit, night shit)
All my night, been ready for you all my night
Been waitin' on you all my night
I'll buzz you in, just let me know when you outside
All my night, you been missin' all my night
Still got some good nights memorized
And the look back's gettin' me right
Every night fucks every day up
Every day patches the night up
On God, you should match it, it's that KO
No white lighters 'til I fuck my 28th up
1998, my family had that Acura
Oh, the Legend
Kept at least six discs in the changer
Back when Boswell and Percy had it active
Couple bishops in the city buildin' mansions
All the reverends
Preachin' self made millionaire status
When we could only eat at Shoney's on occasion
After 'Trina hit I had to transfer campus
Your apartment out in Houston's where I waited
Stayin' with you when I didn't have a address
Fuckin' on you when I didn't own a mattress
Workin' on a way to make it outta Texas, every night
Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift, yeah
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit, kumbaya shit
Want to see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that na na though, could you come by?
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down
See me bummed out, stressed out
That's just everyday shit
Shut the fuck up, I don't want your conversation
Rollin' marijuana, that's a cheap vacation
My every day shit, my every day shit
My every night shit, my every day shit
My every day shit, my every day shit
My every day shit, my every night shit
Hand me a towel, I'm dirty dancing by myself
Gone off tabs of that acid
Form me a circle, watch my Jagger
Might lose my jacket and hit a solo

Ah (solo, solo)
(Solo)
By myself
(Solo)
(Solo, solo)
(Solo, solo)
Now
To the edge I'll race
To the end I'll make it
All the risk, I'll take it
Head bang with my faux friends
We pour a taste out for the dead
This is the blood, the body, the life right now
The height right now
Might be what I need
Might be what I need
Said you wanna hurt me now
You can't hurt me now
That might be what you need
What it means to be alive on this side
(You wanna kill me now) on this side
(Don't let me down) on this side
(Down, down)
Fuck the other side
I'm on this side
I'm on this side
I'm on this side
How it feels to have arrived
I'm inside, I'm inside
Those are my niggas for life
Mothers of us be kind
To the fathers on whom we rely
Fathers of us be kind
To the mothers on whom we rely
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah
We know you're sugar
We know you're sweet like a sucker
Pretty sweet
Pretty sweet
I was just telling that I got this girl before
And we was together since 3 years
And uh, I was not even cheating on her or what
And Facebook arrived and she wanted me to accept her on Facebook
And I don't want it because I was like in front of her
And she told me like, "Accept me on Facebook"
It was virtual, made no sense
So I say, "I'm in front of you, I don't need to accept you on Facebook"
She started to be crazy
She thoughts that because I didn't accept her
She thought I was cheating
She told me like, uh, "It's over"
I can't believe you
I said, "Come on, you're crazy" because like, yeah
I'm in front of you, I'm every day
Here in your house
That's, it means like it's jealousy
Pure jealousy for nothing
You know
Virtual thing
I'll be honest, I wasn't devastated
But you could've held my hands through this, baby
Let my mind run underneath warm jets
I run my hands through what's left
But we're getting older, baby
Don't have much longer baby
Why am I preaching
To this choir, to this atheist?
Just like mine, versions of these belong to you
After a while
They're keeping me close to you
Bad luck to talk on these rides
Mine on the road
Your dilated eyes watch the clouds float
White Ferrari
Had a good time
Sweet sixteen, how was I supposed to know anything?
I let you out at Central
I didn't care to state the plain
Kept my mouth closed
We're both so familiar
White Ferrari
Stick by me (good times)
Close by me
You were fine
You were fine here
That's just a slow body
You left when I forgot to speak
So I text the speech, lesser speeds
Texas speed, yes
Basic takes its toll on me
'Ventually, 'ventually, yes
Ah, on me 'ventually, 'ventually, yes
I care for you still and I will forever
That was my part of the deal, honest
We got so familiar
Spending each day of the year, White Ferrari
Good times
In this life (life)
In this life (life)
One too many years
Some tattooed eyelids on a facelift (thought you might want to know now)
Mind over matter is magic
I do magic
If you think about it, it'll be over in no time
And that's life
I'm sure we're taller in another dimension
You say we're small and not worth the mention
You're tired of movin', your body's achin'
We could vacay, there's places to go
Clearly this isn't all that there is
Can't take what's been given
But we're so okay here, we're doing fine
Primal and naked
You dream of walls that hold us in prison
It's just a skull, least that's what they call it
And we're free to roam
The markings on your surface
Your speckled face
Flawed crystals hang from your ears
I couldn't gauge your fears
I can't relate to my peers
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather chip my pride than lose my mind out here
Maybe I'm a fool
Maybe I should move
And settle, two kids and a swimming pool
I'm not brave (brave)
I'm not brave
I'm living over city
And taking in the homeless sometimes
Been living in an idea
An idea from another man's mind
Maybe I'm a fool
To settle for a place with some nice views
Maybe I should move
Settle down, two kids and a swimming pool
I'm not brave
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather go to jail
I've tried hell
(It's a loop)
What would you recommend I do?
(And the other side of a loop is a loop)
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's not what I'm like
It's just a fond farewell (brave)
Speaking of Nirvana, it was there
Rare as the feathers on my dash from a phoenix
There with my crooked teeth and companions sleeping, yeah
Dreaming a thought that could dream about a thought
That could think of the dreamer that thought
That could think of dreaming and getting a glimmer of God
I be dreaming a dream in a thought
That could dream about a thought
That could think about dreaming a dream
Where I can not, where I can not
Less morose and more present
Dwell on my gifts for a second
A moment one solar flare would consume, so I nod
Spin this flammable paper on the film that my life
High flights, inhale the vapor, exhale once and think twice
Eat some shrooms, maybe have a good cry, about you
See some colors, light hangglide off the moon
I'd do anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you, anything for you
(In the dark)
I'd do anything for you, anything for
I will always love you how I do
Let go of a prayer for you
Just a sweet word
The table is prepared for you
(Ball-ball-ball so hard, boys, boys flex) ooh
(Ball so, ball so hard, boys, boys flex) ooh
(Ball-ball-ball so hard, boys, boys flex) ooh
(Ball so, ball so hard, boys, boys flex) ooh
(Ball-ball-ball so hard, boys, boys flex) ooh
(Ball so, ball so hard, boys, boys flex)
Wishing you godspeed, glory
There will be mountains you won't move
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Still I'll always be there for you
How I do
I let go of my claim on you
It's a free world
You look down on where you came from sometimes
But you'll have this place to call home always
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes (oh)
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind (until it's time)
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes (oh)
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind (oh, it's 'til it's time we die)
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
I'll always love you
Until the time we die
Oh, oh
Mm
If I was being honest
I'd say long as I could fuck three times a day and not skip a meal I'm good
I used to work on my feet for 7 dollars a hour
Call my momma like momma
I ain't making minimum wage momma
I'm on momma
I'm on
Now I'm making 400, 600, 800k momma
To stand on my feet momma
Play these songs, it's therapy momma, they paying me momma
I should be paying them
I should be paying y'all honest to God
I'm just a guy I'm not a god
Sometimes I feel like I'm a god but I'm not a god
If I was I don't know which heaven would have me momma
Let me run this bitch
I'ma run it into the ground momma, the whole galaxy
God damn, fuck these lames, they don't want none
Fuck these lames, they don't want none
Fuck these niggas
Fuck these niggas, they don't want none
Fuck these niggas
Fuck you niggas
Fuck me if I hated on you
I'ma stick around
I'm gon' let my nuts hang
Nigga you got some just like me don't you?
Or maybe not just like me
You know I'm Africano Americano
And even if you're half Japanese
Roots run deep
Family tree, throw a big shadow, tech company
Please gimme immortality
I'm going rapidly
Fading drastically
Or pulled the zip down
Wet your lips first
Lick the tip now
Smoke some'n
They tryna find 2Pac
Don't let 'em find 2Pac
He evade the press
He escape the stress
La da da da da
La da da da da
La da da da da
I'll keep quiet and let you run your phone bill up
I know you love to talk
I ain't on your schedule
I ain't on no schedule
I ain't had me a job since 2009
I ain't on no sales floor
You say I'm changing on you
I feel like Selena
They wanna murder a nigga
Murder me like Selena
You must ain't get the memo
I don't cut bitches no more
But your bitch my exception
Come get her outta my four door
I only got one four door
Remember when I had that Lexus no
Our friendship don't go back that far
Tyler slept on my sofa yeah
Niggas go back that far
I ain't smoked all year
This the last song so
I'm finna wipe that off
Tolerance is so low, still smoke a whole 'gar
Menage on my birthday
Tap out on the first stroke
'Cause this ain't no work day
She don't give head anyway
'Cause what niggas say
That's what she tell her man
What a difference distance makes
Niggas want fight in the streets now
Shit starting to make my hands hurt
Jay hit me on the email
Said I oughta act my net worth
Dog this is chess now
Not fetch I ain't runnin for a nigga
Ain't ran since track meet
That's the only time I ran from a nigga
You could change this track now
Could've changed this bitch a long time ago

Okay

Frank
Yo, aye be quiet
What's your name? What do you do?
What's your first memory?
The first word I learned to say or that I ever said
What's the most amazing thing you've ever witnessed?
You're gonna do amazing out here, control the world, control the world
Hahaha
Hahaha, alright, what three superpowers do you wish you had?
They say they have to be
Flying, super strength
Alright, what's your name?
I wish I could sleep without being dead but sleep forever at the same time
Yo what's your, stop, stop, stop
Being, very very tall
That's fucked up
Start over right now
Best thing about being me is that I keep a pretty clear mind most of the time
Being great
