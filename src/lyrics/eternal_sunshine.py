How can I tell if I'm in the right relationship?
Aren't you really supposed to know that shit?
Feel it in your bones and own that shit
I don't know
Then I had this interaction I've been thinking 'bout for like five weeks
Wonder if he's thinking 'bout it too and smiling
Wonder if he knows that that's been what's inspiring me
Wonder if he's judging me like I am right now
I don't care
I'd rather tell the truth (truth)
Than make it worse for you, mmm (you)

If the sun refused to shine
Baby, would I still be your lover?
Would you want me there?
If the moon went dark tonight
And if it all ended tomorrow
Would I be the one on your mind, your mind, your mind?

And if it all ended tomorrow
Would you be the one on mine?

Bye-bye
Boy, bye
Bye-bye
Boy, bye
It's over, it's over, oh yeah

This ain't the first time I've been hostage to these tears
I can't believe I'm finally moving through my fears
At least I know how hard we tried, both you and me
Didn't we?
Didn't we?

So I grab my stuff
Courtney just pulled up in the driveway
It's time

Bye-bye
Boy, bye
Bye-bye
It's over, it's over, oh yeah
Bye-bye
I'm taking what's mine
Yeah
Bye-bye
It's over, it's over, oh yeah

Ya know?
I'm stronger than I think
Usually, I'd join you on the floor
But this dance ain't for me
Boy, just turn the music up
Maybe someday we'll look back with love
Didn't think you'd lose me
Now it's just too late to choose me

So I grab my stuff
Courtney just pulled up in the driveway
It's time (it's time)

Bye-bye
Boy, bye (boy, bye)
Bye-bye
It's over, it's over, oh yeah
Bye-bye
I'm taking what's mine, yeah (taking what's mine)
Bye-bye
It's over, it's over, oh yeah

Now it's certainly bittersweet
This hook feels too hard to sing
But it's better than repeat (than repeat, than repeat, than repeat)

Bye-bye (bye-bye)
Boy, bye (boy, bye)
Bye-bye
It's over, it's over, oh yeah (bye)
Bye-bye (bye-bye)
I'm taking what's mine (taking what's mine)
Bye-bye
It's over, it's over, oh yeah

Bye-bye (bye-bye)
Boy, bye
Bye-bye
It's over, it's over, oh yeah (bye)
Bye-bye (bye-bye)
I'm taking what's mine, yeah (I'm taking what's mine)
Bye-bye
It's over, it's over, oh yeah

I fall asleep crying
You turn up the tv
You don't wanna hear me
One more sleepless night
Big day in the morning
So I take my time to self-soothe

I'm too much for you
So I really gotta do
The thing I don't wanna do
No, I don't, don't, don't, don't

I don't wanna fuck with your head
It's breaking my heart
To keep breaking yours again (yours again, yours again)
This situationship has to end
But I just can't refuse
I don't wanna break up again, baby (up, up again, up again)

I made it so easy
Spent so much on therapy
Blamed my own co-dependency
But you didn't even try
When you finally did, it was at the wrong time
Won't abandon me again for you and I, I

I'm too much for you
So I really gotta do
The thing I don't wanna do
No, I don't, don't, don't, don't

I don't wanna fuck with your head
It's breaking my heart
To keep breaking yours again (yours again, yours again)
This situationship has to end
But I just can't refuse
I don't wanna break up again (up, up again, up again)

We both know it's time
So we say goodbye
Just one kiss goodbye
With tears in our eyes
Hope you won't, won't regret me
Hope you'll still think fondly
Of our little life

I don't wanna fuck with your head
It's breaking my heart
To keep breaking yours again (yours again, yours again)
This situationship has to end
But I just can't refuse
I don't wanna break up again, baby (up, up again, up again)

Don't wanna break up again
I don't wanna, baby
Situationship has to end
Know it has to end
I just can't refuse

When we're all born, Saturn's somewhere
And the Saturn cycle takes around, about twenty-nine years
That's when we gotta wake up and smell the coffee because if we've just been sort of
Relying on our cleverness or relying, you know, just kind of floating along
Saturn comes along and
Hits you over the head, hits you over the head, hits you over the head and says
"Wake up!"
It's time for you to get real about life and sort out who you really are

Wake up!
Get real

I
I don't care what people say
We both know I couldn't change you
I guess you could say the same
Can't rearrange truth
I've never seen someone lie like you do
So much, even you start to think it's true
Ooh
Get me outta this loop, yeah
Yeah

So now we play our separate scenes
Now, now she's in my bed, laying on your chest
Now I'm in my head
Wondering how it ends

I'll be the first to say, "I'm sorry"
Now you got me feeling sorry
I showed you all my demons, all my lies
Yet you played me like atari
Now it's like I'm looking in the mirror
Hope you feel alright when you're in her
I found a good boy, and he's on my side
You're just my eternal sunshine
Sunshine

So I try to wipe my mind
Just so I feel less insane
Rather feel painless
I'd rather forget than know
Know for sure
What we could've fought through behind this door
Hmm-mmm
So I close it and move, yeah
Yeah

So now we play our separate scenes
Now, now he's in your bed, laying on my chest
Now I'm in my head
Wondering how it ends, ends, ends

I'll be the first to say, "I'm sorry"
Now you got me feeling sorry
I showed you all my demons, all my lies
Yet you played me like atari
Now it's like I'm looking in the mirror
Hope you feel alright when you're in her
I found a good boy, and he's on my side
You're just my eternal sunshine
Sunshine

Won't break

Don't want nobody else around me
Just need you right here
You're like the only thing that I see
It's crystal clear, and I

I want you to come claim it, I do
What are you waiting for?
Yeah, want you to name it, I do
Want you to make it yours

It's like supernatural
This love's possessing me
But I don't mind at all
It's like supernatural
It's taking over me
Don't wanna fight the fall

It's like supernatural
This love's possessing me
But I don't mind at all
It's like supernatural
This love's possessing me
But I don't mind at all

Need your hands all up on my body
Like the moon needs the stars
Nothing else felt this way inside me
Boy, let's go too far

I want you to come claim it, I do
What are you waiting for?
Yeah, want you to name it, I do
Want you to make it yours

It's like supernatural
This love's possessing me
But I don't mind at all
It's like supernatural
It's taking over me
Don't wanna fight the fall

It's like supernatural
(This love's possessing me but I don't mind at all) no, I don't even mind at all
It's like supernatural
(This love's possessing me but I don't mind at all) no, I don't even mind at all

Yeah

I want you to come claim it, I do
You to come name it, I do

This love's possessing me
But I don't mind at all
It's like supernatural
It's taking over me
Don't wanna fight the fall

It's like supernatural
(This love's possessing me but I don't mind at all) no, I don't even mind at all
It's like supernatural
(This love's possessing me but I don't mind at all) no, I don't even mind at all
It's like supernatural

This is a true story about all the lies
You fantasized 'bout you and I
This is a true story about all the games
I know you play
No, this is not what I need (gimme love, love, gimme love)
Not what I want (gimme love, love, gimme love)
Ain't gonna happen to me
Gimme love, love, gimme love, love
Love, gimme love, gimme love, love
Love, love, love

I'll play the villain if you need me to
I know how this goes, yeah
I'll be the one you pay to see, play the scene
Roll the cameras, please

Turning like a dime (dime)
Wasting all their time
Sneaking like a creep in the night
But I'll play whatever part you need me to
Mm-mm-mmm

This is a true story about all the lies
You fantasized 'bout you and I
This is a true story about all the games
I know you play
No, this is not what I need (gimme love, love, gimme love)
Not what I want (gimme love, love, gimme love)
Ain't gonna happen to me
Gimme love, love, gimme love, love
Love, gimme love, gimme love, love
Love, love, love

I'll play the bad girl if you need me to
If it makes you feel better
I'll be the one you love to hate, can't relate
Too much on my plate

See it in your eyes (eyes)
You got too much time
For fun you like to pray for my demise, mm-mmm
But I'll play whatever part you need me to
And I'll be good in it too

This is a true story about all the lies
You fantasized 'bout you and I
This is a true story about all the games
I know you play
No, this is not what I need (gimme love, love, gimme love)
Not what I want (gimme love, love, gimme love)
Ain't gonna happen to me (gimme love, love, gimme love, love)
Ooh-ah (love, gimme love, gimme love, love)
Gimme love, gimme love (love, love, love)

Not what I want (gimme love, love, gimme love)
Not what I need (gimme love, love, gimme love)
Ain't gonna happen to me (gimme love, love, gimme love, love)
Gimme love, gimme love (love, gimme love, gimme love, love)
Love, love, love

How can it be you and me?
Might be meant to be
Can't unsee it
But I don't wanna cause no scene
I'm usually so unproblematic
So independent
Tell me why
'Cause the boy is mi-ine

Something about him is made for somebody like me
Baby, come over, come over
And God knows I'm trying, but there's just no use in denying

The boy is mine
I can't wait to try him
Let's get intertwined
The stars, they aligned
The boy is mine
Watch me take my time
I can't believe my mind
The boy is divine
Boy is mine

Please know this ain't what I planned for
Probably wouldn't bet a dime or my life on
There's gotta be a reason why
My girls, they always come throughin a sticky situation
Say, "it's fine" ("it's fine")
Happens all the ti-ime

Something about him is made for somebody like me
Baby, come over, come over
And God knows I'm trying, but there's just no use in denying

The boy is mine
I can't wait to try him
Let's get intertwined
The stars, they aligned
The boy is mine
Watch me take my time
I can't believe my mind
The boy is divine
Boy is...

And I know it's simply meant to be
And I
I take full accountability for all these tears
Promise you I'm not usually
Like this, shit, it's like news to me
To me
But I can't ignore my heart, boy!

The boy is mine
I can't wait to try him
Let's get intertwined
The stars, they aligned
The boy is mine
Watch me take my time
I can't believe my mind
The boy is divine
Boy is mine

In case you haven't noticed
Well, everybody's tired
And healing from somebody
Or something we don't see just right

Boy, come on, put your lipstick on (no one can tell you nothing)
Come on and walk this way through the fire (don't care what's on their mind)
And if you find yourself in a dark situation
Just turn on your light and be like

"Yes, and?"
Say that shit with your chest, and
Be your own fuckin' best friend
Say that shit with your chest
Keep moving like, "what's next?"
"Yes, and?" yeah

Now I'm so done with caring
What you think, no, I won't hide
Underneath your own projections
Or change my most authentic life

Boy, come on, put your lipstick on (no one can tell you nothing)
Come on and walk this way through the fire (don't care what's on their mind)
And if you find yourself in a dark situation
Just turn on your light and be like

"Yes, and?"
Say that shit with your chest, and
Be your own fuckin' best friend
Say that shit with your chest
Keep moving like, "what's next?"
"Yes, and?" yeah

My tongue is sacred, I speak upon what I like
Protected, sexy, discerning with my time (my time)
Your energy is yours and mine is mine
What's mine is mine
My face is sitting, I don't need no disguise
Don't comment on my body, do not reply
Your business is yours and mine is mine
Why do you care so much whose **** I ride?
Why?

"Yes, and?" ("yes, and? ")
Say that shit with your chest and (say that shit with your chest)
Be your own fuckin' best friend (be your own, be your own)
Say that shit with your chest (say that shit)
Keep moving like, "what's next?" (with your chest now, baby)
"Yes, and?"

"Yes, and?" (hoo)
Say that shit with your chest and (hoo)
Be your own fuckin' best friend (be your own)
Say that shit with your chest
Keep moving like, "what's next?"
"Yes, and?" yeah

I didn't think you'd understand me
How could you ever even try?
I don't wanna tiptoe, but I don't wanna hide
But I don't wanna feed this monstrous fire
Just wanna let this story die
And I'll be alright

We can't be friends
But I'd like to just pre-etend
You cling to your papers and pens
Wait until you like me again
Wait for your love
My love, I'll wait for your love

Me and my truth, we sit in silence
Mmm, baby girl, it's just me and you
'Cause I don't wanna argue, but I don't wanna bite
My tongue, yeah, I think I'd rather die
You got me misunderstood
But at least I look this good

We can't be friends
But I'd like to just pre-etend
You cling to your papers and pens
Wait until you like me again
Wait for your love
My love, I'll wait for your love
I'll wait for your love
My love, I'll wait for your love

Know that you made me
I don't like how you paint me, yet I'm still here hanging
Not what you made me
It's something like a daydream
But I feel so seen in the night
So for now, it's only me
And maybe that's all I need

We can't be friends
But I'd like to just pre-etend
You cling to your papers and pens
Wait until you like me again
Wait for your love
My love, I'll wait for your love
I'll wait for your love
My love, I'll wait for your love

I'll wait for your love
I'll wait for your love
I'll wait for your love
I'll wait for your love
I'll wait for your love

Hung all my clothes in the closet you made
Your shoes still in boxes, I send them your way
Hoping life brings you no new pain
I rearrange my memories, I try to rewrite our life

But no matter how I try to
And no matter how I want to
And no matter how easy things could be if I did
And no matter how guilty I still feel saying it

I wish I hated you
I wish that weren't true
Wish there was worse to you
I wish you were worse to me
Yeah, I wish I hated you

Our shadows dance in a parallel plane
Just two different endings, you learn to repair
And I learn to keep me in one place
So close and yet so far if only we had known from the start

But no matter how I try to
And no matter how I want to
And no matter how easy things could be if I did
And no matter how guilty I still feel saying it

I wish I hated you
I wish that weren't true
Wish there was worse to you
I wish you were worse to me
Yeah, I wish I hated you


My boy
Come take my hand
Throw your guitar and your clothes in the back seat
My love
They don't understand
But I'll hold your hurt in the box here beside me

How could we know
We'd rearrange all the cosmos, mmm?
We crashed and we burned
Now I just can't go where you don't go
And usually I'm

Fucked up
Anxious
Too much
But I'll love you like you need me to
Imperfect for you

Messy
Completely
Distressed
But I'm not like that since I met you
Imperfect for you

Let's go tonight
'Cause there's just a few seconds left till tomorrow
We have
All that we need
Let's leave our baggage and wine at the table

Mmm, how could we know
That this was a happy disaster, mmm? (happy disaster)
I'm glad we crashed and burned (we crashed and burned)
I'll never forget when you told me
You said, "usually I'm

"Fucked up
Anxious
Too much
But I'll love you like you need me to
Imperfect for you"

Messy
Completely
Distressed
But I'm not like that since I met you

Mmm, how could we know
We'd make the bad stuff delightful, mmm?
I'm glad we crashed and burned
I know we'll be there for each other
When we're feeling

Fucked up
Anxious
Too much
But I'll love you like you need me to
Imperfect for you

Messy
Completely
Distressed
But I'm not like that since I met you
Imperfect for you

Fucked up
Anxious
Too much
Like you need me to
Imperfect for you

Messy
Completely
Distressed
Not like that since I met you
Imperfect for you


We could go pop all the champagne in California
We could have omakase in Tokyo if you wanna
Hypothetically we could do anything that we like
We could hit up all the slopes in matching snowsuits
We could hang out at the louvre all night if you want to
We could spend every dime
But I don't want anything but more time

No matter what we do
There's never gonna be an ordinary thing
No ordinary things with you
It's funny but it's true
There's never gonna be an ordinary thing
As long as I'm with you

You hit just like the first sip of wine after a long day
You hit like my biggest fan when I hear what the critiques say
You hit just like a green light when I'm stuck runnin' real late
I don't need no diamonds, just your time

No matter what we do
There's never gonna be an ordinary thing
No ordinary things with you
It's funny but it's true
There's never gonna be an ordinary thing
As long as I'm with you

Ordinary thing, ordinary things with you
Ordinary thing, as long as I'm with you

And when he'd come home and I'd see him, when he first gets off that train
It was like God almighty arrived
It was like seeing daylight
I mean, I could've packed up and left a million times, you know, it's not that we never fought
You can overcome that, you know? it-it's very easy, and as I told her
Never go to bed without kissin' goodnight
That's the worst thing to do, don't ever, ever do that
And if you can't, and if you don't feel comfortable doing it
You're in the wrong place, get out
