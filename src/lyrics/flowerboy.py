lyrics = '''
How many cars can I buy till I run out of drive?
How much drive can I have, until I run out of road?
How much road can they pave, until I run out of land?
How much land can it be until I run in the ocean?
Niggas go with the motions and all the plans
See, I was never into the beaches and all the sands
See, I was in the woods with flowers, rainbows and posies
Falling out of my pocket, but ya'll want to know if I swam to cool down
How much cooler can I get until run out of fans?
How many fans can I have till they turn on the AC?
If the AC blow up, then I'm TNT, I'm gone
I'm gone and I'm finished
And I ain't seen my friends in a minute
Guess that nothing lasts forever
No, nothing lasts forever
Nothing sticks together
Sick of sitting in doubt
Please let me figure this out
Shoutout to the girls that I lead on
For occasional head and always keeping my bed warm
And trying they hardest to keep my head on straight
And keeping me up enough 'til I had thought I was airborne
How many raps can I write 'til I get me a chain?
How many chains can I wear 'til I'm considered a slave?
How many slaves can it be 'til Nat Turner arrives?
How many riots can it be 'til them Black Lives Matter?
When niggas click, clack, splatter, pew, pew that nigga
Life a game of basketball, you better shoot that nigga
Cause if that cop got tricky, he better pull
Cause when I get pulled over, I usually play it cool
Cause I know what I'm driving is usually paid in full
And my ego and possessions, will not let me be one
Be-cause I got a mansion, my mansion got some rooms
And rooms got some windows and my windows got some views
And views get some stairs and my backyard does too
And if you walk to the bottom, you'll probably see a pool
You better not drown, keep them ten toes up
Cause if those ten toes down, that mean that you fucked up
And that's what I swim in
And if I drown and don't come back?
Who's gonna know? (Baby, then I'll know)
And if I crash and don't come back?
Who's gonna know? (Baby, then I'll know)
And if I fall and don't come back?
Who's gonna know? (Baby, then I'll know)
I'm wondering if I don't come back
Baby, then I'll know
Don't come back, no no
Ayo
Let's take it back to them days
Counting sheep on Sadie Hannah's floor
Carpet was my baby mama
80 dollar profit from the coffee I poured
Rent-A-Center calling everyday
Nobody home, they're knocking on the door
Now I skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
In toys I only dreamed that I could afford
Now I roll through Okaga, California
I ride to California
These frog oval goggles
I'm leaning out the window
OJ shining on me
Simp-Sun shining on me
Slick circles floating out this world
Yea yea
Run it, run it, run it, run it
I rock, I roll, I bloom, I glow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (what you say?), I bloom, I glow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (let 'em know), I bloom, I glow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (One more time), I bloom, I grow
(Let's go!)
Ain't nobody fucking with T, but that may just be my ego
But don't be too cool, you may freeze
Because niggas get stuck in the cold (man, look at this ice)
Shit weighs a ton, water your garden my nigga and stunt
(Stunt on these niggas)
Tell these black kids they could be who they are
Dye your hair blue, shit, I'll do it too
Look, I smell like Chanel
I never mall grip with my manicured nails
I coconut oil the skin
I keep the top low 'cause the follicles thinnin'
But other than that, man, it feels like I'm winning
Went from statistic to millionaire
CNN doubted 'cause my skin is dark
But they forget when I get in my car
These frog oval goggles
I'm leaning out the window
OJ shining on me
Simp Sun shining on me
Slick circles floating
Vro we off this world (yeah yeah)
Run it, run it, run it, yo
I glow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (what you say?), I bloom, I glow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (let 'em know), I bloom, I grow (I grow)
I rock, I roll (one more time), I bloom, I-
(Let's go!)
Flower boy T, nigga that's me
Rooted from the bottom, bloomed into a tree
Took a little while, nigga making leaves
Keep 'em in the branches so my family can eat
Favorite color green, energy is strong
Giving niggas life like birdies and the beez
Dropping them seeds, not what you want
You don't know what I keep in the trunk
Ah, shit!
Run it, run it, run it, run it
Run it
Run it
Run it
Sometimes, I sit in my room
It's Golf Radio, you're on the air with Shane Powers
Taking requests
What's uh, what's your name? Hello?
Um, okay, well, since, you want to be Mr. Fucking Secret Agent, what song you wanna hear?
The one about me
Okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, oh
You live in my dream state
We're lowkey my fantasy
I stay in reality
You live in my dream state
Any time I count sheep
That's the only time we make up, make up
You exist behind my eyelids, my eyelids
Now I don't wanna wake up
20/20, 20/20 vision
Cupid hit me, cupid hit me with precision
I wonder if you look both ways
When you cross my mind, I said, I said
I'm sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasing
You're the one that's always running through my daydream, I
I can only see your face when I close my eyes
Can I get a kiss?
And can you make it last forever?
I said I'm 'bout to go to war
I don't know if I'ma see you again
Can I get a kiss? (Can I)
And can you make it last forever? (Can you)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war ('Bout to)
I don't know if I'ma see you again
(Uh, switch it up)
I said, okay, okay, okay, okidokie, my infatuation
Is translatin' to another form of what you call it? Love
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, I ain't met you
I've been looking, stuck here waiting for I
Stop the chasing, like an alcoholic
You don't understand me, what the fuck do you mean?
It's them rose to the cheeks, yeah it's them dirt-colored eyes
Sugar honey iced tea, bumblebee on the scene
Yeah I'd give up my bakery to have a piece of your pie
Yugh!
20/20, 20/20 vision
Cupid hit me, cupid hit me with precision
I wonder if you look both ways
When you cross my mind, I said, I said
I'm sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasing
You're the one that's always running through my daydream, I
I can only see your face when I close my eyes
(So)
Can I get a kiss? (Can I get a kiss?)
And can you make it last forever? (Oh, forever)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war (Go to war)
I don't know if I'ma see you again (See you again)
Can I get a kiss? (Can I)
And can you make it last forever? (Can you)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war ('Bout to)
I don't know if I'ma see you again
Okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, okay, oh
La la, la la la la, la la
La la, la la la, la la
One more time?
Yo, who dat boy? Who him is?
Him that nig-ga, I swear
Stand up guy, him don't need no chair
Well, where the fuck him at?
'Cause nigga, I'm right here
I don't shop at the mall, all y'all just
Dumb mothafucka
I'm a goddamn artist
You can give me some markers and I'll draw you a closet
And you know that it's GOLF
Bitch go on and make the deposit
Nigga fresh to death like he got dressed in a coffin
Cons, overalls, and a striped shirt
The boy drip swag like a broken faucet
It's runnin', nigga, I'm runnin' shit
That cherry be the bomb like he ran in Boston
Won't stop 'til the cops surround him
One nigga jiggy and the other awesome
With his fuckin' face blown off, that's how they found him
It's Young T
Who dat boy? Who him is?
Who dat boy? Who him is?
Nigga, who dat boy? Who him is?
Who dem boys? Nigga, who dem is, nigga?
Why you niggas feel like that?
Mad 'cause a nigga neck chill like that
Mad 'cause a nigga push wheel like that?
Why you puttin' bad vibes in the air like that?
Nigga who dem boys?
Who dem is? Nigga, who dem is?
Who else step in this bitch this jig?
Who else your bitch say got a Bic this big?
Who else came through with a wrist this flick?
Nigga, Guess my pants, do my dance
Spin around, bitch, you could kiss my ass
Never seen a nigga in this much Raf
Still doin' math when I miss my class
Was it Summertime '06, had the number Nine
Nigga, never mind, was another time before Vince
Had the Gucci gold tips with the letterman
Nigga, dollar sign was my favorite number at the time
Fresh freshman 'til they skip my ass
Senior citizen, don't forget my pass
Been that nigga and you knew that there
Make the dick disappear, how she do that there?
Who dat boy? Who him is?
Who dat boy? Who him is?
Nigga, who dat boy? Who him is?
Who dem boys? Nigga, who dem is, nigga?
Why you niggas feel like that?
Mad 'cause a nigga neck chill like that
Mad 'cause a nigga push weight like that?
Why you puttin' bad vibes in the?
Fuck the rap, I'm tryna own a planet
From my other fuckin' business ventures
These niggas these days
Actin' like some bitches, like they're fuckin' with ya (yeah)
Teeth is glistenin', Jesus, Christmas
He just shittin', she exquisite, bitches be expensive (oh, no, nigga)
And I don't even need attention
WANG$AP on the bumper sticker, fuck you niggas
Fuck global warming, my neck is so fr√≠o
I'm currently lookin' for '95 Leo
My mom say she worried because I'm so ill
I should stay in bed, but got too much bread
To make, she said watch my weight
So I stayed home and start eatin' some meals
Get out of my way, way
Boy that's McLaren, that's zero to sixty in two-point-nueve, I'm gone
Fuck
My mother warned me that some nigga's ain't my right hand
To trust her, only my heart and that elder white man
His name is Clancy, I fancy him, gotta give him props
He half the reason why dealerships even let me cop
So now I'm speedin' and tryna drive away from the fact
That she was right, so I triple left, tryna double back
The streets are filled with some clues, like how I ain't notice that?
(How I ain't see that?)
Fuck it, I seen some familiar stuff in the culdesac
I pull up, get out, what up?
I wanna help, but what you want for some
Some niggas really don't want for themself
Now do I stay? Do I go? That's my dilemma
And traffic is picking up, if I don't leave I'ma get stuck (skrrt)
So I speed off, we talk barely and it seems awk-
-ward, and I heard through some words that you off it
I got too much drive, don't wanna steer off path
And crash and get distracted
But I listen to that weather man 'cause it might rain
Keep my windshield wipers prepared 'cause y'all threw so much shade
And I got jacket in trunk, but that's in the front
I also got power for both of us if you're ever in need of jump
Just let me know, my nigga
I had to switch the gears on 'em
Fishtail in the rearview mir' on 'em (Skrrt!)
I had to switch gears on 'em
You know, swerve, left turn, steerin' wheel on 'em
Nigga that's a pothole, watch out for the pothole
Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole
Look out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole
Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole
Snakes in the grass, but I walk
I got some new boots, on the back it says GOLF
So I be prepared for their bites, they're all talk
I left the condom in the grass so fuck off
Watchin' Clarence in a mansion with nobody in it
Young successful nigga, ride McLaren with no windows tinted
I draw my piggies when I'm in it 'cause it feels amazin'
The irony is I stopped eatin' bacon
Don't get it twisted, nigga, I'm still hungry
Oh he lonely
All my friends talk about their hoes and tenderonies
All I can show 'em is a couple cars and more things
That I've made in the couple past month, he's on, please
Everyone is a sheep, me, a lone wolf
Nobody gon' make a peep 'cause everyone wants some wool
Since everyone is a sheep, not everyone here is cool
Man I'd rather drown in a pool by myself than fuck with their fleece
See, man, T-Man fans be seesaw
Wind blows, they go, which way, who knows?
One day, "Fuck no, " the next day, "Okay"
But fuck y'all, I know that T is four for four
I just want that garden and that Batmobile
Good health, success, time on earth worthwhile
Find somebody who love me and raise a couple of lizards
But my vehicle's good for now, that's in a couple of miles
I keep it pushin', nigga
I had to switch gears on 'em
Fishtail in the rearview mir' on 'em (Skrrt!)
I had to switch gears on 'em
You know, swerve, left turn, steerin' wheel on 'em
Nigga that's a pothole, watch out for the pothole
Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole
Look out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole
Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole
Fuck, okay, next one
Gotta watch out for the potholes
Said watch out for the potholes
Don't kill the rose
Before it could bloom
Love every flower
Out the cocoon
You don't have to hide
I can smell it in your eyes
That there's something more to say, baby
Them words
Damn, run me back, yeah
If I could, if I could
If you could
Find the words to say
Find the words to say
Find the words
In the garden
Shed
Go
Don't kill the rose
Before it could bloom
Love every flower
Out the cocoon
Ayo
Garden shed, garden shed, garden shed, garden shed
For the garden
That is where I was hidin'
That is what love I was I in
Ain't no reason to pretend
Garden shed, garden shed, garden shed
Garden shed for the gar√ßons
Them feelings I was guardin'
Heavy on my mind
All my friends lost
They couldn't read the signs
I didn't wanna talk and tell 'em my location
And they ain't wanna walk
Truth is, since a youth kid, thought it was a phase
Thought it'd be like the Frank; poof, gone
But, it's still goin' on
Big fan of the base 10
Polka dot knows, how it goes
Had to keep it on the subwoofer
A couple butterflies when I float
I was always like eh
Barely interested, but I bag just to brag to my boys like bruh
This is a crucial subject matter
Sensitive like cookin' batter
'Til the temperature that's risin'
Steppin' on that ladder
Tryna grab the rings of Saturn
I'm a plant it by the time you hear this
Chittin' chatter, 'bout to heat it
It will not fuckin' matter
When you're having fun (fun)
When you're having fun
Fly out the window (go, go, go)
Find some time
Find some time to do something
Find some time
Find some time to do something
Find some time
Find some time to do something
Boredom got a new best friend
(Boredom, boredom, best friend)
Cause boredom got a new best friend (oh, oh, oh)
Boredom got a new best friend
Find some time
Find some time to do something
Find some time
(Find some time, oh)
Boredom, boredom, boredom, boredom
Boredom, boredom, boredom, boredom
Boy, my bedroom floor is a cereal burial, I'm serious
I ate 'em all, dry boxes, bodies, yeah I count 'em
If we're talking about real meals
Ask my stomach, he ain't saw 'em
I've been in this fuckin' room so long
My eyeballs are turning to dry wall
My friends suck, fuck 'em, I'm over 'em
"Hi y'all, y'all ain't hit me all day
What the fuck is the problem? Is it me?
Cause I'm not solved, I'm, bored."
Find some time
Find some time to do something
Find some time
Find some time to do something
Find some time
Find some time to do something
(Oh)
Boy's getting' desperate as hell
Cellular not amusing and I hope someone will
Message me with some plans that are amusing as well
Cause I haven't seen the exit of these walls, but fall this morning
(Morning, morning, morning, morning)
Got some calls I can handle
But nowhere for performance
My stomach angry and yelling'
I need some food, I go order
But I hate eating solo
Need someone we can loiter in parking lots
And sunsets at the border, yeah
Ringy dingy dong, I can't be alone
I been starting to feel like
I don't know anyone
So now I'm staring at my ceiling fuckin' going
Like I don't know where I'm going
No idea where I'm going
Tick tock
(Damn, gotta get outta here)
Find some time
Find some time to do something
(Hey, can y'all help me right quick?)
Find some time
Find some time to do something
Find some time
Find some time to do something
(Oh)
Cause boredom got a new best friend
Boredom got a new best friend
Cause boredom got a new best friend
Find some time, find some time
Gotta find some time, find some time
Gonna find some, find some time
Gotta find some time, find some time
Gonna find some, find some time
Gotta find some time, find some time
Gonna find some, find some time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time
Time, time, time
"Ride's over, we got some tickets to see s-"
Right now we got some new music only here on Golf Radio
(God I love this sample)
We're going to dance
And exercise
I ain't got time for these niggas
Better throw a watch at the boy
Had my boys in this bitch, lookin' like a seminar
Who the fuck you talkin' to motherfucka?
Boy I ain't got time for these bitches
Better throw a clock at these hoes
Had these hoes in this bitch lookin' for a water hose
Who the fuck you talking to, muthafuckin boy?
Boy I ain't got time
Boy, I need a Kleenex
How I got this far? Boy, I can't believe it
That I got this car, so I took scenic
Passenger a white boy, look like River Pheonix
First, (Happy birthday!)
You bitch ass nigga yep, I'm thirstay
The little shots that you threw, they ain't hurt me
I ain't fuck with you bitch ass in the first place
I ain't got time for these niggas
Better throw a watch at the boy
Had my boys in this bitch, lookin' like a seminar
Who the fuck you talkin' to motherfucka?
Boy I ain't got time for these bitches
Better throw a clock at these hoes
Had these hoes in this bitch lookin' for a water hose
Who the fuck you talking to, muthafuckin boy?
Boy I ain't got time
Man it turned out B was so proud of me
Cause all these (motherfuckers!) got they style from me
I bet they all looking from the crowd at me
And if I ask them, they'll bow to me
But, you a house nigga, so you don't know
How that shit go with my big lips and my big nose
And my big dick and my short hair
Cuz' you already know how slow my shit grow
Tick tock
Tick tock
Tick tock
Tick tock
Been the man with a bigger plan
Niggas know the deal
When I set upon, bet I get a 100 mil'
Next line, I'll have em' like woah
I've been kissing white boys since 2004
One need to See three Ms
Four, five, six years ago
Suck selling figure
Conversations with Converse finalized, 'cause Vans fucked up
I'mma be common, so you gon' need commas
Saying what I shoulda did, but you ain't did nada
You ain't important
I'mma keep sporting
All smiles over here
Shout out to the garden
(Tick tock)
And, I just handle all my business like a chess board
(Tick tock, tick, tock)
And them golf boys, that's my muthafuckin' set boy
Hard pill to swallow like some thick soda
Walk wit' it, 'cause my pockets look like thick Yoda
Do the Skywalker, riding round' sola
And the kid skin sprite, and my tint cola
Getting neck from the ball like some big shoulders
Til' I bust like that 9 in your heat holster
Everything I say is hot, bitch I speak toaster
And I bred orthodox like I eat kosher
Shout out to (shhh) they gave a big loafa
Green bread, I be chilling like a clean sofa
It's that thick odor
Young money T
Young fuckers, black boy, oh silly me
(I ain't got time!)
Better talk shit
'Cause I'm either in my Cons or my Golf shit
Pants got a little flood, nigga pipe down
A lil uzi, lil boosie way I wipe down
(Boy I ain't got time!)
To be sittin' here right now
'Cause niggas dying every day
And I ain't light brown
And i-D ain't wanna give a nigga no pose
So I went and did a 12 page spread in Vogue
(Nigga I ain't got time!)
Listen man I'm dat boy
All you lil niggas clones, boy I feel dat boy
You better kill that noise
Turn around and remap route
When they see that boy with them figures and that gap tooth
Tick, Tock
Tick, Tock
Tick, Tock
"Fuck Hello"
Call me, call me, call me, uh
Call me, call me, call me, uh

Nine-one-one (call me) call me some time
(You should call me) nine-one-one, call me some time
(You should call me, oh) nine-one-one
(Call me) nine-one-one
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My thirst levels are infinity and beyond
Sippin' on that lemonade, I need a Beyonc√©
Can't see straight, these shades are C√©line Dion
Sucks you can't gas me up, shout out to Elon
Musk, yeah I got a sold out show
Crowd wild out but don't matter 'cause you not front row
I've been lookin' for a keeper, listen to the speaker
If you fit description, hit me on my beeper
At that nine-one-one
Call me some time
Ring, ring, ring
Please bang my line, you know I'll answer

Ring, ring, ring

Nine-one-one (call me) call me some time
(You should call me) nine-one-one, call me some time
(You should call me, oh) nine-one-one
(You should call me) nine-one-one
Chirp, chirp
Chirp, chirp
Woke up in the burbs, burbs
With the the birds, birds
Where you used to come and get me with the swerve, swerve
These days you gotta find time
Even the night line
Work line
Dial nine
Five car garage
Full tank of the gas
But that don't mean nothin', nothin'
Nothin', nothin', without you shotgun in the passenger
I'm the loneliest man alive
But I keep on dancin' to throw 'em off
I'm gon' run out of moves 'cause I can't groove to the blues
If you know any DJs, tell 'em to call me at nine-one-one
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Old lonely ass nigga (I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck)
Need to go somewhere and get some bitches or something
Weird ass nigga
I can't even lie, I've been
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely
They say the loudest in the room is weak
That's what they assume, but I disagree
I say the loudest in the room
Is prolly the loneliest one in the room (that's me)
Attention seeker, public speaker
Oh my God, that boy there is so fuckin' lonely
Writin' songs about these people
Who do not exist, he's such a fuckin' phony
One thing I know, is that I wanna
Win so bad, but I'm not Chicago
Heart is low, it's real low, it's so low
You can't lift me up, I'm like Gallardo
From the start it's been real dark
It's been so dark I guess that you could call me charbroiled, huh
I'm playin' like Hasbro
I'm really Saari, call me Arto
Crashed the McLaren, bought me a Tesla
I know you sick of me talkin' 'bout cars (skrrt)
But what the fuck else do you want from me?
That is the only thing keepin' me company
Purchase some things until I'm annoyed
These items is fillin' the void
Been fillin' it for so long
I don't even know if it's shit I enjoy (oh)
Current battle as an adult
My partner is a shadow
I need love, do you got some I could borrow?
Fuck it, I could find some tomorrow
Woah, but that never comes
Like a vasectomy, what have I done?
I got the talent, the face and the funds
Found myself long ago but I haven't found someone (who)
Mirror, mirror on the wall (who)
The loneliest of them all (me)
Cupid actin' stupid
Do you got another number I could call?
Never had a pet
I've never had a pet
There's more fish in the sea
But I never had a goldfish to begin with
I never had a dog
So I've never been good with bitches
'Cause I never threw a ball, fetch
I never had a pet, that's where it stems from, I bet
Treat me like direct deposit
Check in on me sometime
Ask me how I'm really doin'
So I never have to press that nine-one-one
Oh! Damn! Damn!
Mula!
Like Adam in the garden of Eve
My bitch got an apple bottom and she swallow my seeds
Follow my lead, fire I breathe, water my sea
And sit back and watch money grow on trees
Droppin' C's like classes, these hoes drop they asses
I drop a seed in her panties, if it smell like pansies
I'm a banshee in her panties, nigga, ask your mammy
Never played golf, but got a driver and a Caddy
Whole squad slammin' like Onyx, you know sticky fingaz
Some dropped science, I'm droppin' English
Even if Tyler, named the song flower
No seeds in the bud, still don't trust bugs
I'm down
Droppin' seeds on these niggas
They can't fuck with the boy (Mula!)
Droppin' seeds on these bitches
For the love of the sport
I'm droppin' seeds, got this garden
Flowers poppin' of course
I'm droppin' seeds, motherfucker
Weezy Baby the boy! Yugh!
Say some more, never want to talk about it
Feel a way, woah
Feel a way, woah
Feel a way, woah
Take me back to November
Take me back to November
Hawaiian shirts in the winter, cold water, cold water
Yeah, take me back to November, wassup
Can we go back to November?
Take me back to November
Hawaiian shirts in the winter
Deep thoughts, deep thoughts
Naw, take me back to November, wassup
What if Clancy fuckin' me over?
What if 'Who Dat Boy' is rhetorical and this shit is over?
What if I'm hustling backwards?
What if my accountant ain't payin' my taxes?
Fillin' his pockets, and IRS show up asking me questions
I couldn't answer 'cause I was too busy trynna make classics
What if my music too weird for the masses?
And I'm only known for tweets more than beats or
All my day ones turn to three, fours cause of track seven
Fuck, what if I get stuck? What if I got comfortable?
I gotta keep it buck fifty, what if I lost it all and
Ended up back in Ladera at them shitty apartments that's across the Bank of America
Damn, I would be hurtin', writing all of these songs
'Cause Wi-Fi wasn't working, last year in total
I put out two verses
But five seven figures since then, life's kinda perfect
Oh is it really? Oh is it really? Bitch you know the dealy
Really, Hilly, Willy, Tilly, Silly
Hold that billy how I Milly Rock
When they can't relate him, when they start to hate him
They don't drive these cars
So whats they ultimatum?
Tell me, whats your November? Is it a person?
Mine was the Summer '06, I remember the
What if I thought the brake was the gas?
What if I crashed?
What if these deep thoughts was my last?
Let me pull over, quick!
And drive back to November
Take me back to November
Hawaiian shirts in the Winter, cold water, cold water
Yeah, take me back to November, wassup
Can we go back to November?
Take me back to November
Hawaiian shirts in the Winter
Deep thoughts, deep thoughts
Naw, take me back to November, wassup
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back, take me back
I ain't doin' fine
Lost my mothafuckin' mind, time travel back and help me find
Take me back take me back
Take me back take me back
"My November is right now"
I wrote a song about you, I want your opinion
I consider my heart rate has slowed down at the ending
Cause the love I got for you has exceeded appearance, the lyrics
Matter of fact, I'mma just call you, so you can hear it
If you do answer, I play it to state facts
Although I already know the response you gon' say back
At that point I'll hang up, disappear and just stay back
And if you don't I'll leave a voicemail with the playback
Hello, no one is available to take your call, please leave a message after the tone
Da na na na na
Da na na na na
Da na na na na, my baby
You've been on my mind
(How ya feel?)
I'm losing my mind because
I hope that we can be more than just friends
Firework
I feel like glitter, and every time you come around
I feel like glitter
You're the one that I wanna give my life
You're the one that I need to give my time
Ayo, mirror mirror on the wall, who the brightest of them all?
I never been the darkest one, 'cause my self esteem is tall
So I never seen eye-to-eye with y'all niggas, ayo
Uno peso, never paid attention to what niggas gotta say-o
So I keep that buck, I ain't give no fuck, then bill me up so I block 'em like Lego
Feelin' glitter, feelin' good and great
Got the burner got the heat like wait
Got the shit, its all up on that head
I use it on myself on the day you dipped
Got that 4-5-7 track, 8 for me
Babydoll, I hope you agree
Because you light my
Firework
I feel like glitter, and every time you come around
I feel like glitter
(How you feel?)
You're the one that I needed in my life
(How you feel?)
You're the one that I needed in my life
'Cause I love having you around (I love)
'Cause I love having you around
Yeah, look at my face, look at that jaw
This is north side and yeah, I can't lie
We ain't workout, we a fat boy
Yeah, sumo, gotta limo
Pills, can't see-through, must be a window
'Cause you in the L
'Could be a DJ, when I see you my heart beat changes tempo
Yeah, simple, that's what I want but I can't
That's who you are but I ain't
How ya feel?
I'm parkin' in quicksand, wait-
Please don't save me
Ooh
(Please don't save me)
How ya feel?
Fa la la la la
Fa la la la la
How ya feel?
